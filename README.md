He had his legs spread out wide enough to know it irked his parents, but not quite enough to look sloppy or uncivilized. As he chewed the pork and legumes in his mouth, an unsavory taste ran down the back of his throat, his teeth catching on the sheer toughness of the bite, the edge of it all disagreeing with his usually forgiving palate.

“Has our food always been so...revolting?” Jungkook asked, fighting back the urge to spit it back out. If none of them were going to say it, then he would.

His mother and father acted out not listening, his father finishing his evening paper and his mother asking him to pass the salt. They rarely paid him any attention. He shifted his gaze to the left. His older brother stared at him quietly from across the table, never one to bother getting involved. Jungkook had always found him too proper. So proper it bordered on appearing lily-livered.

“Well? Are we rationing for war?” He pressed, dropping his fork down on the plate. He wouldn’t eat any more if it was inedible. They had money, so why would they settle for less than the best? It was like silver meant nothing these days. Like their names were not worth properly cooked meat.

“I think the servant’s boy has started helping out in the kitchen,” his mother mused quietly, chewing on a brussel sprout. Her face was screwed up in concentration, as if trying to remember something, making her wrinkles deepen like a craped piece of fabric. “The lanky, little one. Could have sworn I remember the thing being swaddled in secret only yesterday.”

She sounded like she did not care much to one end or another. Jungkook scoffed. The quality of their service and household was falling apart, and he was the only one looking out for it. Soon they’d let horses come around and run the kitchens, never mind some snotty-nosed child.

“Darling, the boy’s about the same age as our Jungkook, if not a little older. Surely, you’ve seen him walking around, helping with chores,” his father said. And then, they were lost in their meaningless conversations again, paying no mind to the real issue at hand. Jungkook curled his upper lip up in disgust, pushing the plate away from himself.

“He looks just like his mother and walks like a ghost; he barely lets himself be known,” his mother countered with, but was now busying herself with the floral decoration on the table, straightening it out. “Goodness, I got these just yesterday. And to think, he would sell me violet ones.”

His mother and father, the honorable Lady and Lord Jeon, left the table once they were satisfied, retreating to the tea room to retire for the night. Namjoon, his older brother, spared him a glance from across the room, before he, too, disappeared from sight, no doubt to retire to the library.

Jungkook stood by the dining table, musing at it. He ran a finger over the silk tablecloth, tracing it then over the unused silverware and over a wine spill from his mother. He grimaced down at his refused plate of food, glancing back towards the door to the kitchens. Surely, what his parents did not know would not concern them. But it was something he would irk himself over to no end for days, spoiling his mood rotten. And what then? They would grow even more wiry with him. And he would grow wirier with them, yet. And then he would have to hear from Namjoon something about being callous and the cause of it, despite being the only one in the house looking out for their interests and honour.

He pursed his lips, picking up his plate of food. He could feel the unpalatable texture just by looking at it, and gripped it tighter in his hold. How he was watching the grace of their house fall by pure negligence. The disrespect so blatant and loud his parents had to be void of all wit to dismiss it.

Jungkook turned on his heel, carrying the plate with him as he made a stride towards the kitchens, one hand gripping the edge of his fitted vest. The floorboard creaked under him, his shoes loud and demanding where he walked. He turned through the small backside corridor, unable to remember the last time he’d walked in those quarters. When he was a child. Or perhaps, not even then. He’d never liked the smell of lard and scrubbed dirt wafting from there. He didn’t think it necessary to ever involve himself in matters beneath him.

He stepped into a short, ajar door, seeing pots and pans and fire stacked together amongst hanging poultry and messes on the floor for him in the kitchen, in all its foul-smelling glory. In the corner, peeling apples, was hunched a small boy, deeply concentrated with his task. Despite the apron he wore, which was clearly two sizes too big for him, he had managed to dirty up the sleeves of his shirt and even the dark material of his trousers.

Jungkook cleared his throat, making the boy jump. When the servant turned around and saw him, he seemed beside himself, dropping the apple and his knife with an almost practiced, comical gasp.

“Y-young Master,” the boy greeted him with, wiping his hands on his trousers with haste before dropping to his hands and knees in a deep bow, floor barely creaking under him. His long hair dangled in front of his eyes, and he seemed to chance a look or two up at Jungkook, shuffling where he’d kneeled. He looked vaguely familiar, like Jungkook had actually seen him around his estate before. As a part of the furniture, perhaps. Easy to overlook. Easy to forget. The wide, glass eyes that were overlooking him, however, did not seem so forgettable.

“You’re staring,” Jungkook chastised, holding the boy’s gaze firmly. The boy looked away quickly, seeming unsure of what to do with his hands, and now, also his eyes.

“Sorry,” the boy murmured. He seemed to straighten up a little, gaze fluttering from Jungkook, to the plate, and then back to his apples. They fixated on Jungkook again, as if waiting for instruction.

“You’re still staring,” Jungkook remarked, annoyed with the lack of clear direction and the fiddling about. “Have you never seen a man before?”

The boy seemed to fight with himself to figure out whether that was supposed to be a rhetorical question or not. Jungkook wondered if that would be giving the thing too much credit. Servants were stupid, after all. Couldn’t read, couldn’t write, and always smelled like they couldn’t clean themselves, either.

“I’ve seen men, Sir,” the boy said, unsure. He was stuck in limbo between getting up and staying low as a sign of respect. Of holding his cloth still or using it to finish his work. Of talking and remaining quiet.

“I’m sure you have,” Jungkook answered him mockingly.

He threw the metal plate he was still holding down onto the old, wooden kitchen table, some of the food splattering off with the impact. The boy would have to clean that later. It made the servant flinch.

“What’s this?” he asked, gesturing to the plate with his head. The servant boy definitely looked lost now, his big eyes darting between the plate and Jungkook’s eyes.

“Your dinner, Sir?” he tried, straightening up, as if a little more confident. The cheek of him.

“Really?” Jungkook questioned. He huffed, grabbing some of the gooey slob in his left hand and staring at it for a quick moment. The servant boy looked scandalized, rising up on his feet as if ready to help clean his Master off with the cloth he had over his arm. “Then why does it taste like excrement?” Jungkook growled, fixing his eyes menacingly down at the servant boy, who seemed to be shaking.

“I-I don’t understand—“

“Son of a cook, but can’t absorb any of her skills? Remarkable,” Jungkook accused, holding his dirty hand up in the boy’s face. The boy stared at his hand so intently that his eyes crossed. Then, he just stood still, gaping like a goldfish. Jungkook had had enough of his flummoxing.

He reached behind the boy and fisted his dark hair, yanking his head back as if in a practiced move. As soon as the servant opened his mouth to gasp, he stuck two food-laden fingers into his mouth, catching his breath.

“You must really not know how disgusting your food is,” he sneered, shoving the dinner in as he force-fed the scraps to the servant. The boy choked ever so slightly, reaching up a hand to hold onto the arm Jungkook was using to choke him for purchase. “Eat it yourself. I’m not eating a plate of sick.”

He pulled his fingers out of the servant’s wet mouth, the smaller boy breathing hard and flailing in front of him.

“I’m sorry, young Master. Forgive me,” the smaller boy managed to utter, bits of food still holding onto his spit-slick lips.

“We can have you out in a second,” Jungkook lied, watching the boy’s glassy eyes with almost too much fixation. His brown orbs were swimming in wetness; whether from physical discomfort or humiliation, he wasn’t sure. Nor did he care. “Anyone could take your place. So you had better make yourself useful.”

The boy nodded eagerly, finally wiping his mouth. Jungkook didn’t know why, but he felt a desire to soil him again. Completely ruin his face with it.

He refrained.

“Don’t make me tell you again.”

The following days were drab and dry. His mother had got him another tutor, someone who would teach him poetry this time (—for romance’s sake, she claimed wistfully—) and gawk at him while he scribbled noncommittal stanzas in his own notebook with an irked bite of his lip.

The man was balding, sagging skin hanging under his neck already and a bad knee. He was practically dead, let alone sufficient to inspire passionate and amorous phonaesthetics, sound, metre, and prosaic meaning. A waste of time and space.

“How is it coming along, Jungkook?” the man asked him, eyes looking hopeful and excited, despite Jungkook not replying to him since they’d started the lesson. Jungkook could smell his foul breath from his close proximity, tightening his fingers around his ink pen.

A sound emerged to their left, and he looked up to spot a familiar face in the door. He saw his brother walk into the study, presumably to get out to the gardens. God, he always did what he wanted. Sure, he was plenty older, but their parents did not seem as intent to torture him as they did Jungkook. Him and his perfectly capable brain and artistic integrity. The floor bent under Namjoon—let him step his polished, booted feet wherever he wanted them—while Jungkook scraped at scraps for his honour, were it not promptly decimated by his parents first.

“Jungkook?” The tutor asked, pulling him out of his sordid reverie. “Did you finish?”

“Against your nape, my lips move
slow as sheepfoot blades
I breathe the night into your hair: rapine manifest
Read my lips, my mind,
tell me what the new day has found here in your unmade bed,
beside this pale flesh of God in the sough of the wind,
his horses long since climbed to Heaven.”

The pause after that stanza was substantial, the man doing somewhat of a double take, the breath meaning to be exhaled hastily and audibly retracted.

“Goodness me, son,” the tutor huffed over his notebook, eyes grazing the words he had just read a second time. Jungkook could see a pearl of sweat build its way down the side of his temple. “Goodness,” he continued mindlessly, moving his pupils further down the page, down the other poems, his face growing more pale as he did so. Jungkook watched him shift in his seat, suppressing a grin. Passion was passion, no?

“I can write another,” Jungkook offered, pulling the pot of ink towards himself, an eager air about his previously listless demeanor as his pen tightened in his hold.

“That’s alright,” the tutor assured him, pushing the notebook away from himself with a brittle smile. He swallowed a bout of saliva, hands reaching for his shirt to straighten it, most notably where it sat tight around his neck. “I better get going.”

“Suit yourself,” Jungkook commented, leaning back in his chair. His father would hate him for finishing their lessons so early. Not to mention for spooking off another tutor. But alas, it was not his doing. He was but a poet in the rough, yearning for unfettered and absolute expression.

He heard rushing steps away from him in the distance, a door closing, and sat still with himself while holding his pen, gazing out the window to the gardens where he assumed his brother to be. It was a nice day. The weather was nice. But he would stay indoors, because he did not like it much. Nice weather came with sweat, smells, and bugs. It was unruly in an unsettling way; one he didn’t much care to admire. Some things he cared to admire more.

He flicked his gaze down to the pot of ink in front of him, dropping his pen next to it. It was stout with ink, dark as night and shining in its depths. He exhaled, leaning back in his chair.

Some things he cared to admire more.

He leaned forward, using his fingers to push at the pot, scraping it loudly across the surface, until it tipped off the edge of the study desk. A loud clunk and a wet splatter sounded into the room, ink flying as far as his shoes, dotting them with little, black spots, masqueraded into their black, leather surface.

He got up, walking around the side of the desk, and saw the ink sprayed angry over the floorboard. He grinned to himself, turning backwards and leaving the study, ready to find himself some entertainment.

He found it in the form of the small servant boy, furiously polishing his mother’s most recent wood carving monstrosity. After searching almost long enough to lose his interest, he’d found him in his father’s study, most likely of as little use there as he was anywhere else.

“You,” he said pointedly, glaring down at the boy. Those wide eyes flew up at him, his hands flinching around the wooden figure. He was utmostly attentive, polishing job forgotten. “You ruined our floor.”

“What?” the boy said, eyes gradually steeping with fear and horror.

“What?” Jungkook mimicked in a high tone, lifting his face up to glare down at him with turned lips. “I said you ruined our floor,” he repeated, knowing full well the boy wasn’t begging a repetition.

He shuffled forward as if to grab the boy and yank him with, but the boy was already up, clutching the felt cloth he’d been using. Taken aback by the action, he hesitated for a second, before fisting his hand into the boy’s loose, cream shirt, pulling him after his stride as he made for the other study by the gardens.

The servant followed obediently behind him, allowing himself to be pulled forth as they raced over the loud floor, stumbling at times, but catching himself. He heard a soft sound of anxiety at a particularly harsh tug, and finished their journey by almost throwing the servant into the room.

The servant stumbled, looking around himself in the stuffy, bright room, then back at Jungkook, who walked in behind him, sour and a hand firmly on his hip. Jungkook pointed to the black splatters covering the floor, waiting for the servant’s protests.

“You did that, so fix it,” he spat, observing the boy expectantly.

To his surprise, the boy rushed down to the ink, wetting his cloth on his tongue before getting to work, wiping at the stained wood with vigour. He glared, suddenly feeling annoyed that the servant wasn’t questioning anything—wasn’t putting up a fight.

“If I catch you ruining something in our house one more time, I’ll report it,” he hissed into the silent room, purposefully. He held his breath, telling himself to calm down. He would get it. His desired outcome. The servant boy stopped in his tracks, head turning back towards him.

And there it was. Wide eyes, slightly trembling shoulders. Wetness pooling close enough to seem akin to the beginning of tears. Jungkook practically preened.

“Just do as I say, and nothing will happen. You can make it up to me,” Jungkook insisted, walking up to the servant with slow steps, before reaching his crouched form and stepping on his cloth. “Your name,” he demanded.

“Jimin,” the servant boy said, quickly as if to avoid further punishment, but slow enough to betray his mind’s state of disarray.

Jungkook felt his mouth tug up into a deceitfully placating smile. The servant boy looked up at him attentively, his entire being devoted to whatever words would spill from Jungkook next.

Now this was more thrilling than poetry.

He grabbed a chair from the desk, dragging it over the floor so it creaked loudly into the room, before sitting on it, facing the boy on the floor. He could see wisps of struggle in the servant’s eyes as he struggled between this interaction and his obligation to fulfill his previously established orders.

“Master says clean it up, Jimin,” Jungkook grated with a low timbre, robbing his attention from being elsewhere, eyes trained intently on the boy’s small form.

The servant looked up at him with impressionable eyes, arms wobbly as they moved to put his order into practice. Jungkook knew he was the lowest on the rank of authority in their home, being the youngest. But he’d be sure to show their servant that disobeying him would bring more pain and suffering than from anyone else in their family combined.

Jimin bowed his back so low his nose was practically shoved into the floor, bringing his now ink-stained cloth towards himself to scrub desperate circles into the wooden panels. Jungkook watched in sadistic glee as the cloth served to muddy the mess further, his servant’s underequipped tools easily not the correct ones for the job.

“That’s funny,” he drawled from his chair, his head leaned into his hand apathetically. “I thought I told you to clean.”

When he got up this time, it almost seemed like the servant was anticipating the retribution, resigned to a slowing movement as he heard his Master walk closer with carefully averted eyes.

“Do you mock me?”

The servant quickly shook his head, now meeting his eyes in utter petrification. They both knew he would never dream to do that. That’s what made it all the more thrilling when Jungkook stepped his booted foot onto the servant’s shoulder, shoving him into the inky mess on the floor, his already disgusting shirt soaking in the back liquid.

Poetry.

Jimin looked down at his soiled shirt in his hands, still able to see the marks of the ink even in the pale lighting of his cot. He was unsure of how to tell his parents about the incident—or at least about the ruined shirt, because he would need a new one. It would be insulting for him to walk around the estate looking raggedy and dirty. At least, more overtly so than was his original state.

He listened to his parents soft breathing from beneath and beside him, hiding the shirt under his pillow. Surely, they would blame him. In a way, Jimin blamed himself, too. He’d been stupid enough to use a dry cloth to attempt to clean an ink spill. He’d just been concerned for his own skin and not the beauty of the century old wood paneled floor, and so he’d received apt punishment.

He could still feel the imprint of the tough boot on his shoulder, his skin prickling as he thought back to the anger on his young Master’s face and how his entire time and attention had been directed only at him. Jimin was unsure how he, a mere servant, had managed to command so much of the young Master’s attention in only two days. It was a sign of his lacking skill, that was for sure. But before the young master had seen him in the kitchens, he had grown accustomed to just being ignored, his mother and father scolding him and wiping up his messes before their heads of house even noticed. It was almost like young Master Jungkook went looking for him, in a way that nobody else did.

No, of course he didn’t. How stupid. How silly. The young Master had a multitude more important things to be occupying his time and mind than someone like Jimin. Jimin was invisible, hidden under the estate when he wasn’t working to sleep, and crawling on the floor to clean when he was up above. He was meant to not be seen or heard, meant to be a smudge in the backdrop of the estate’s tapestry and doing his work all but mum. Barely acknowledged, barely watched. Taught by his parents to do things the way they did them, and to not be a bother by way of sight or hearing.

He touched the shirt under his pillow as he lay his head there, trying to sleep. He breathed deeply, fiddling with the shirt and trying to keep his mind off the imprinted foot on his back, his head swimming with unnecessary, excessive thinking. It wasn’t his job to think. It was his job to do all the unsavory tasks in the estate and pretend he wasn’t there.

But young Master Jungkook had pulled up a chair in that room and watched him. Had sat there until Jimin had cried from the inability to clean the ink from the floor. Master Jungkook with his slick hair, sharp jaw and demanding eyes.

He had seen him.

Namjoon didn’t eat in silence, like he usually did. Though their dinner was drab and dull as always, this time Jungkook wasn’t complaining about something to their parents, which was odd. Their mother and father usually let him get away with it, too afraid of Jungkook’s fits to put up a fight. But today, Jungkook was decidedly quiet—calm, even. Satisfied?

“Poetry lessons treating you well, Jungkook?” Namjoon asked, observing the way Jungkook’s brows relaxed as he chewed on the tender meat. More tender now than usual. Funny how that was, after Jungkook’s outburst.

Jungkook appeared almost insulted that he would ask, but feigned pleasantries nonetheless. Namjoon made no ruckus of it.

“I’m having a ball,” Jungkook replied coolly, still respecting Namjoon’s authority enough to not look him in the eye as he said it.

Namjoon smiled fleetingly, turning his attention back to his food and taking a bite. The meat definitely was more tender these days. He could hear their parents quarreling lowly while he chewed, completely oblivious to their exchange.

“What’s your favourite Haywood stanza?” Namjoon pressed when Jungkook had gone back to enjoying his food, not dignifying him with looking up as he spoke.

This earned him a disdainful glare from his younger brother that he could feel on his forehead, hot to the touch.

“I believe it goes:
‘That is none of your concern,
the willow tree sings, ‘fuck off’,
into the night’.”

Namjoon stopped eating, glancing up finally and looking to his parents, who missed the blatant disrespect he’d just received. Jungkook just smirked to himself, stealing his father’s wine cup for a quick sip.

“Mother,” Namjoon demanded, feeling uneasy as his little brother’s antics, that usually got stopped in their tracks, went unchecked. “Jungkook’s having a mouth.”

Their mother turned to Jungkook, unimpressed, while still folding her napkin a different way for the third time that evening.

“Are you having a mouth at your brother, Jungkook?” She pushed, Namjoon knowing she mostly took her eldest son’s side in disputes, and was grateful for it. He just wished she had the spine to really teach that spoiled brat a lesson.

“Most definitely not,” Jungkook countered with, already back to eating his dinner with much enjoyment. Namjoon’s blood simmered with irritation, because there was nothing his mother could say to counter that.

“Eat your food,” she just pressed to Jungkook, who was already doing exactly that.

Namjoon didn’t miss the shit-eating grin his brother sent him from across the table, wondering when exactly things had gotten so out of hand. It would be too easy to blame it on their father’s drinking or their mothers lack of care.

He wasn’t blind to the smell of burnt embers swept under their best rugs.

The booted footsteps sounded behind him, slow and menacing. Jimin felt his heart-rate pick up, the anticipation and performance anxiety he was feeling hanging low in his chest and high in his throat. Without checking, he could tell the young Master was behind him. He could feel young Master Jungkook’s eyes on him, watching his every move as he moved his achy limbs over the hard floor, the fabric of his shirt suddenly feeling choking.

He grabbed the wet cloth tighter, putting more of his back into rubbing the oil stain in the Mistress’ room off the porous, wooden flooring. It creaked under his effort, and he wished it wouldn’t. He didn’t want the young Master to pay more attention to him than he already did. At the same time, he wanted to prove his worth. That even if he wasn’t his father or mother, he was useful. The newfound attention was awful, but he was not sure he could stand it going away.

Without warning, a heavy hand pushed on his head, his neck forced down. He squeaked, struggling to steady himself with his arms.

“Clean properly. Must I teach you everything?”

“N-No.”

The touch in his scalp burned, even long after Master Jungkook had shoved him so cruelly. It felt like a privilege—the young Master having his hands on him still, even when it was no longer necessary. The large hand was threaded through the tresses of his hair, warm and heavy as it rested there. Jimin was left dizzy in its wake, face heated and breath careful as he tried to concentrate on cleaning the mess, when all he could do was think about how undeserving but blessed he was to feel the young Master’s touch.

The touch left his head, but he was still feeling dizzy, breathing harder as he clutched the cloth. There was a tingle where the touch had been, despite it being so rough. Or perhaps, because it had been. He felt delirious.

“If you did it properly in the first place, I wouldn’t be forced to waste my time correcting you,” the young Master muttered.

“I-I’m sorry,” was all Jimin could think to say. How could he say anything that would be apologetic enough for not being good enough? How could he fail his Master over and over again and still somehow be requested to serve him? “I’ll be better.”

“I highly doubt that,” young Master Jungkook retorted, snorting. Jimin’s lip trembled, but he forced it stiff, cleaning in earnest. “You’re pretty useless.”

Jimin sunk lower, cleaning harder, eyes prickling with tears. He blinked them back as best as he could, while also trying to ignore the ripple of flush he knew had spread down his nape and spine.

“Aren’t you, Jimin?” the young Master pressed, suddenly sounding much closer than he had been before. Jimin saw his Master’s feet in front of him, and then he was squatting down next to his face. Jimin felt hot, his throat constricting as he almost saw his Master’s face up close. A rough hand grabbed his chin, yanking it up. He was made to stare directly into young Master Jungkook’s eyes. “Aren’t you useless?”

A few warm, soppy tears slid down his face before he managed a nod, limbs so shaky he was almost unable to hold himself up. But Jungkook held him by his chin in a vice, not about to let him crumple on the floor any time soon.

“Say it.”

Jimin sniffled, making the mistake of looking into Jungkook’s eyes for a split second before he trained his gaze on the walls near the curtains. He breathed hard through his nose, his mouth clamped shut at the force of Jungkook’s hold. Suddenly he couldn’t breathe, his neck strung up too taut. His weak arms reached up and flailed as they scrambled to hold onto Jungkook’s punishing hand, trying to alleviate any amount of pressure he would let up.

“Jimin’s useless,” he squeaked out in an almost intelligible way as a last resort, crying in Jungkook’s hold. He saw the corners of Jungkook’s lips lift up in what resembled a smile. Before he felt a release that he’d expected to come after being obedient, he heard the door behind them open, not even sure when it had been shut, and suddenly Jungkook was holding onto him tighter.

There was an odd moment of silence wherein the only sound in the room was Jimin’s panicked breathing and sullen hiccuping, and even that seemed too loud.

“Is Mother out?” a deeper voice asked into the room. Jimin recognized it as Master Namjoon’s voice—the eldest son. He had never interacted with him before, personally, but had seen him at dinner and sometimes in the halls. He was smart, well-spoken, and polite. He never felt a need to raise his voice. Despite his voice sounding deeper, it was also softer than Jungkook’s. And he had nice hair.

Young Master Jungkook kept silent for a few moments. He gripped Jimin’s jaw ever tighter, as if to signal him quiet, too. Jimin wondered if Master Namjoon could see his ugly, horribly wet face.

“How would I know?” Jungkook responded, in a way that pressed that he was currently occupied.

“You’re in her room.”

“Well, I don’t know,” his young Master said, voice sounding angrier. It made Jimin tremble. “And I don’t care.”

Silence, again. Then, footsteps of someone retreating.

Jimin didn’t know whether to be elated or more fearful, now. When Jungkook moved to close the door back up, he settled on fearful.

A rare day of rest and regaining the feeling in his almost numb, prickly hands while sitting out of the way by the fence in the garden overlooking the swaying wheat crops felt eerily out of place. Still, Jimin smiled into the speck of sunshine that shone down from the otherwise cloudy sky. The wind that was neither cold nor warm whisked up his hair and billowed it around his face.

As he sank his bare feet into the grass under his toes, he wondered if that cold, refreshing feeling could make him feel more than the boot mark seemingly permanently imprinted on his shoulder could. How would the grass see him? How would it hold him and demand of him and force him to let go of himself? How would it whisper the cruelness of the world to him in choice words fit only for passionate hatred. Soothe him it could, but the soothing felt only half as immense without the sting beforehand.

He closed his eyes, toes wiggling again. If he tried hard enough, he could smell the lake from there. And harder yet, the forest further over. Vast, observable unknowns that made him feel small and claustrophobic.

“Hello.”

Jimin jolted up, whipping his head around and grappling at the stone ledge he was perched on.

Master Namjoon walked his way from the house, more in control of his body than Master Jungkook had ever been. He was slow about it, where young Master Jungkook was brash. His hair was also billowed by the wind, though his skin wasn’t slick with sweat from hours in the kitchen, bunching said hairs up unattractively on his forehead.

“My name’s Namjoon,” the Master offered, as if Jimin wasn’t fully aware already. His body language was open, inviting. Jimin bit his lip, suddenly feeling invasive for sitting in the gardens, though his mother had claimed he was allowed out. The fresh air felt almost like a luxury he shouldn’t be afforded. “What’s your name?”

He chewed on his tongue, looking past Namjoon and back towards the door, that looked dark in the now overcast light from outside. He looked back up at Namjoon, pulling his feet out of the grass.

“Jimin.”

Namjoon considered him for a second, eyeing his feet, hair, and hands. Jimin only just noticed that Namjoon was dressed in his night-wear.

“Hi, Jimin. Are you alright?”

He was unsure of the protocol for such a question. Most of his responses were relegated to ‘Yes, Master,’ ‘Please, Master,’ or ‘No, Master’. This was new, and uncomfortably so.

“Yes, Master,” he tried, not sure what the right answer could be. Was this a test? If so, how could he pass it? Was Master Jungkook watching?

“Does Master Jungkook hurt you?” Was the next thing out of Namjoon’s mouth. Jimin gasped, scandalized. He didn’t say anything, merely staring up at Master Namjoon, which he was aware was terrible to do. Staring was rude. He was just so confused. Would he be in trouble? Was he already in trouble? “Are you afraid of him?”

Jimin blinked, glancing around himself. Nobody else was there. Nobody else could see.

He nodded, yes. How could he not be? Then caught himself, and shook his head, no. No, he wasn’t. His young Master only ever punished him for his own failures. And Jimin was not afraid of his own failures. He was unapologetically able to own up to his own shortcomings.

“It’s okay, Jimin,” Namjoon continued, lowering his head. “You can speak candidly to me,” Namjoon said with a soft voice, smiling at him. Jimin swallowed hard, unsure of the situation, which was just about as foreign to him as when young Master Jungkook had first started lavishing him with attention. “I need to know if Master Jungkook hurts you and treats you badly.”

Jimin shook his head adamantly. No.

“Are you sure?” Namjoon asked, seeming unconvinced. He seemed to pretend to join Jimin in surveying the wheat fields and smelling the faint hint of lake in the air.

Jimin nodded.

“Alright,” Namjoon said. Then he sighed, deeply. Goosebumps rippled over Jimin’s skin, and he could almost feel the breath from Namjoon’s nose at their proximity. “My room is on the second floor next to the painting of the willow tree. If you get scared, do not feel afraid to come to me.”

Jimin just stared at him, even after an awkward silence wherein Namjoon finally turned on his heel and strolled back inside. The curtains flapped in the wind at the door Master Namjoon had left open. Jimin stared at it until the grass no longer looked green in his peripheral vision, the sun set into darkness.

Jungkook enjoyed baths in the dark cloak of night, moonlight being the only thing illuminating his skin in the glisten of lukewarm water. He inhaled a deep breath of air, the room smelling of wax and smoke from a few candles near the vanity. In the corner of the room, barely hit by moonlight himself, stood Jimin, holding a cloth towel ready for whenever Jungkook would choose to emerge from his wash. He smiled to himself as he gazed over his servant’s downcast eyes, his posture small and cowering against the wall. Jungkook would be lying if he were to pretend at least half of that demeanor wasn’t his doing. His slow and deliberate moulding.

He raked a wet hand through his long hair, feeling the tug of it as he mused on the pitiful form in the corner. His eyes then travelled down his own wet chest, toned to perfection from his vigorous outdoor activities. Lower yet stirred a monstrous desire he had been feeling and listening to as it grumbled for attention, spurred by nothing other than the feedback loop that had been tethered to the boy near him, licking at his most surreptitious urges and coaxing them out so, so easily.

He exhaled so hard it rippled the water, cocking his head to the side. He let his eyes wander to his content.

“Don’t feel like putting in work, Jimin?” He heard the cutting edge of the words himself before they even reached the servant, feeling his own skin riddle with goosebumps. The reaction from his servant was instantaneous, multiplying his own elation by tenfold as he swallowed the curls and ribbons of fear, anticipation, and yearning emanating off of the small boy.

“Master,” Jimin croaked, dropping the towel unceremoniously as his eyes widened in attention, searching Jungkook’s for guidance amidst his shock. “What can I do for you?”

“Why do people take baths, Jimin?” Jungkook offered unhelpfully, gut clenching deliciously at the clueless look in his servant’s eyes. The interaction wasn’t fair to Jimin, but he didn’t mean for it to be. It was Jungkook leading the conversation and the reactions, completely and utterly in control of the outcome and the way it played out.

“I…” Jimin looked around, then back at his Master, unsure of what to say. “T-To wash up?”

“Exactly. What a good boy you are,” Jungkook praised mockingly, giving Jimin a pitiful smile. Jimin heated red, visible even in the pale moonlight. Jungkook leaned a wet arm over the edge of the ceramic tub, tilting his head back at an angle while he admired the flush spreading over Jimin’s cheeks and down his neck. “You don’t expect me to wash myself, do you?” He said, trying to sound pitiable.

Jimin’s eyes widened, Jungkook following them down to his wet chest. The servant shook his head slowly, eyes flying around as if to try and piece together the right thing to do from observation alone. Jungkook let him struggle for a few seconds, before beckoning him towards him with a lazy hand, bathwater rivulets dripping down to wet the wooden floor. His mother would be upset. Luckily for him, she was preoccupied with becoming a neurotic mess.

Jimin walked towards him, eyes having a hard time staying on Jungkook as he stepped all the way up to the tub, gaze resting on Jungkook’s shoulders as he got close enough for Jungkook to grab. Jungkook didn’t grab, but he did take Jimin’s hand into his thumb and pointer finger, exerting unusually soft pressure around the flesh for his usual demeanor.

“Wash me,” he commanded.

Jimin looked like a fish out of water, gaping at him, not knowing how to do what he was being commanded to do. And it wasn’t like Jungkook didn’t know that. He just smiled up at him, unable to stop the quirk of his lips from turning up into a smirk. Jimin’s trembling hand sent jolts of pleasure to his already stiff nether region, the head of his cock now visibly bobbing above the horizontal line of the water. Jimin would have to avoid that little mistake with all the decency in him. Jungkook, of course, was equally ashamed. So, so, utterly embarrassed. Devastated.

Eager still to listen and to do good, Jungkook watched his servant reach for the bar of soap on the edge of the tub, touching it to Jungkook’s chest and applying gentle pressure. He looked to Jungkook for guidance, as if asking if he was doing okay. Jungkook, usually too impatient to care but feeling particularly benevolent, leaned his head in his hand and gazed down at Jimin’s ministrations.

“Go on,” he urged, feeling lazy and satiated as Jimin began rubbing at his chest, using both his small hands and the soap piece to clean along his skin. Jungkook rarely had muscle aches or any blemishes, resulting from him barely having to lift a finger in his personal or professional life, but having his flesh touched by surprisingly gentle hands was a treat. He’d expected Jimin’s hands to be callous from all the hard work, disgusting even, but somehow the cleaning work he did must have softened them, because Jungkook didn’t hate the touch as much as he’d expected to. Continuing in earnest, Jimin cleaned down his chest to his abdomen, submerging his shirt sleeves in a determined effort to please him with following instructions.

He licked his lips and chuckled internally when Jimin hesitated and tried to work around the glaring erection he was sporting in the water, standing proud and intrusive in the murky darkness of the edge of the tub. He watched him gulp, accidentally brushing against it with his arm. The doe eyes he’d grown elated with dampening looked to him, then, heavy but chaste with what Jungkook could only assume was repressed arousal.

“Are you done?”

Luckily, he didn’t have to wait long before Jimin seemed to decide he hadn’t cleaned everywhere, getting to work with wrapping both soap and palm around his hardened flesh, working around it. He groaned, digging his toes into the end of the tub as he fought back violent urges that involved grabbing the servant so hard he would never recover the use of his arms.

“Your hands are too rough, stupid boy,” Jungkook barked; a stocky lie. He didn’t want to bother putting in effort. He wanted to sit back and be serviced, like he should. To have his bliss in the darkness; in the moonlight, free from distractions and judgement. A taste of reward for putting up with the maniacal goings on around the manor. He wanted his spoils for winning the war of wills in the house. He wanted his own, personal recompense. “Do you want to use your mouth?”

“Mouth?” Jimin aped back in a tiny voice, frozen with a hand still fisted around Jungkook’s manhood, his cheeks pink in haze. Jungkook smirked, tracing a pair of his wet fingers down Jimin’s jaw.

“You’re salivating at the sight, aren’t you? You can put your mouth on it and swallow me clean.”

Jimin’s clothed arms fell into the water for purchase, followed by his coughing into the water as he reached for Jungkook’s tip with his tongue and pouty lips. Jungkook actually groaned when he felt the pillowy twins latch onto his tip in earnest, his servant having practically half submerged himself in the water to get the angle right to suck him off. Jungkook reached a hand in his hair to help him down, bucking his hips up slightly. He heard the telltale sound of gagging, then a choke, his balls tightening instantly.

“That’s it.”

He felt Jimin’s mouth move, chuckling to himself. He dragged him further into the water, pressing the pads of his fingers against Jimin’s throat as he forced his cock down it, all but drowning him. To his surprise, his little servant let himself be maneuvered like a doll, limp in his hold and allowing Jungkook to use his mouth in the water, only bubbling and coughing for air when he absolutely needed it. Otherwise, whining and huffing in pleasure. The best part was that he couldn’t tell if the boy was crying or sweating or disinterested because of all the water splashing around his head and face, rendering him passive as he took Jungkook into his mouth and throat until the Master was satisfied. The harder he tugged and further he thrust his hips, making Jimin gag on it, the louder his little moans became.

He curled his feet and bucked up particularly hard when he felt close, grabbing Jimin’s wet hair and thrusting into his warm mouth, thinking about his teary eyes, his small body, and his obedient demeanor. The slick wetness was so warm and easy to rock into, velvety smooth against his sensitive flesh and growing tighter yet from spasms, swallows, and coughs. He closed his eyes, licking his lips as he continued to thrust, ignoring the servant’s futile attempts at using his mouth and tongue to pleasure him.

Jungkook released his semen into Jimin’s waiting mouth while holding his head still and pulling his hair back to have a look at his face, hearing the whiny choking as he startled the smaller boy.

When he was all done, he let go, resting his head back against the wall, finally feeling the last of his tension leave him. Jimin pulled off him shakily, coughing and drooling spit and semen into the water as he hung over the edge of the tub, wet body sagging over Jungkook’s knees. Jungkook grimaced, shoving at Jimin’s chest with his legs to tip him back over the edge and onto the floor.

“Don’t get that shit in my bath water,” Jungkook snarled, grabbing fistfuls of tainted water and hurling it at Jimin, who flailed around on the floor, flinching at the assault. He crawled back and away, letting Jungkook have a glimpse at his red-rubbed, swollen lips and wet chest, which had been exposed with the friction. In a sordid, fucked up way, that sight alone was more satisfying to him than the whole ordeal that had just occurred. He yawned, feigning boredom and leaning back with semi-closed eyes. He saw Jimin move closer to him, coming back as if to finish his cleaning; to go for more. Jungkook glared at him, crossing his arms over his chest. “Get out so I don’t have to look at you like this. It’s pathetic.”

He refused to move even an inch as he heard Jimin struggle and rustle around on the floor, hastily doing up his blouse and trying to stand up on shaky legs. He sat still, enjoying the sounds of quick feet padding across the washroom, sprinting hastily to get out of Jungkook’s sight.

Poetry, perhaps.

Namjoon heard the footsteps before he saw him, sitting up a little straighter in his room as what sounded like a wet sprint closed in on his door. Just outside, he could hear heavy, hitched breathing, someone clearly hesitating right near his quarters. And he knew exactly who it might be. He considered walking towards the door to open it, but worried he might scare off the boy. He had told Jimin to come to him, after all. Whenever he wanted to. It wasn’t his place to chase down their servant like some madman and order him to tell him this or that, to do this or to do that. The boy had his own will, and his own limits. His own thought processes. The problem was, Namjoon wasn’t so sure the boy was all too aware of them himself. Sure, him being a servant did not diminish his ability to think for himself or his feelings, but Namjoon couldn’t help but worry for him nonetheless.

“Jimin?” He tried to ask as carefully as possible, asking it into the empty room and into the quiet hall. The panting outside stopped, and for a second he was worried the boy had left, until he heard a strangled sob from outside.

Namjoon bit back his better judgement and got up, walking towards the door as calmly as he could. When he opened it, the sight of Jimin, wet and hair mussed up, face red but pale at the same time, greeted him. He bit back a reaction, settling instead for looking the servant over and checking for bruises or marks from suspicious treatment.

“Why are you wet, Jimin?” He asked calmly, willing the boy to look at him. Jimin didn’t, instead opting for gazing at his chest and keeping it at that level. Hesitant, perhaps. Deferring his position.

“Why does he hate me?” Jimin mumbled almost inaudibly into the silence, not at all answering his question, but clearly distressed about something. “Why must I be disgusting?”

“Who? Is this about Jungkook?” Namjoon asked, furrowing his brows. He had known for a while that Jungkook acted a certain way around Jimin that most people, even of their standing, would consider...unsavory. Cruel. He’d seen some of it himself, and the rest he could guess and piece together based on how Jimin carried himself around the manor. He’d always found Jungkook to be spoiled rotten, and too mouthy for his own good. Though initially, he’d just thought of it as a childish phase that would soon blow over. Maybe after a few years in the real world, forced to learn from his father’s trade, would he better himself and his demeanor. Though years later, and now with this new development, they seemed as far away from that as they had ever been. “You’re not disgusting,” Namjoon pressed, reaching a hand out to place on Jimin’s wet shoulder. The boy flinched back from his touch, as if he didn’t want it. Didn’t need it.

“I do everything he tells me to,” Jimin continued, for the first time since Namjoon had met him speaking up without inhibition. “I would do anything for him,” the servant breathed, almost as if in a trance. Namjoon could see pure devotion on his face, adoration even. Lovesickness? Longing? Strong, attached emotions that Namjoon had never thought anyone could feel towards his brother, of all people. “Why can’t he see me?”

“Jimin…” Namjoon was lost for words, raking his gaze over the boy’s frazzled attire and demeanor. He tried again to reach out to steady him, however, as if sobered up this time, Jimin flinched back, seeming to catch himself in a most embarrassing position. He shook his head while blushing furiously, taking a few steps back. Namjoon, foolishly, reached out a hand to stop him, sending the boy into a newfound panic.

“I’m sorry—Master, I-I never meant to disrespect—”

“Jimin, it’s okay—”

“Please forget it. Please, I didn’t mean to…to come here, or say anything, I...”

Namjoon kneeled down to look up at the servant’s distressed face, eyes imploring as he spoke to him.

“You can tell me if something is wrong,” Namjoon said firmly, grabbing a hold of the boy’s hand and stroking it gently. “You can talk about what’s hurting you,” he added, smoothing his thumb over the boy’s delicate wrist.

“You wouldn’t understand—n-nothing is hurting me, I just—” he looked remorseful for his harsh tone, bowing down to Namjoon and pulling his arm away shyly. “Please—forget I came. Please do not mention that I spoke to you.”

“Do not tell Jungkook?” Namjoon hinted, trying to pry it out of him. Jimin’s expression went sour. He shook his head.

“I-I did not say that,” Jimin pushed, walking further away while Namjoon stayed still on the floor, kneeling for him.

“Okay, Jimin,” he tried, wary of the smaller boy seeming to withdraw more and more into himself. He knew he wasn’t obliged to Jimin’s time or thoughts, but a part of him had such a strong urge to be of aid that he couldn’t repress it.

“I will see myself to bed, Master,” Jimin whispered, face pale as he retreated, the weight of how much he’d talked seeming to nauseate and frighten him as Namjoon observed him walking away. He was left to his own thoughts in the hallway that were scattered alongside the wet footsteps that had been left behind just moments prior.

Whenever highly esteemed guests came to visit the manor, Master Jungkook always took an interest in the girls. They would come in carriages accompanying their fathers and mothers in pretty dresses, cheeks pinched to crimson perfection. Jimin would stand back by the walls of the dining room, watching Jungkook speak sweet on them right under their parents’ noses, all charm and smile and lifted brows. They’d flutter their pretty eyelashes at him back, craning their neck to expose ever slightly more of their shoulders; just enough to not be labelled harlots. Master Jungkook would respond with an intense gaze and pointed mouthful bites of tender meat, eyes trailing from their red lips to their frill-covered breasts. Jimin felt guilty for noticing, but he didn’t have much else to look at when forced to stand at the family’s beck and call for hours on end while they ate into the night. Besides, his young Master was so obvious about it; Jimin did not know how none of the adults noticed.

Then, at night, the girls would sneak out of the guest room to find young Master Jungkook. Jimin had come across them once or twice while cleaning the halls for the night and making sure the basins in the washrooms had clean water. The sound of the young Master secretly taking the girls to bed to impress on them his manhood would travel with the wood panelling; thudding, moans, and hushed whimpers wafting into the hallways while Jimin worked, his fingers shaking as he folded towels into their cupboards, feeling like he was accidentally intruding on the Master’s privacy. But still, he could not cover his ears, or he would be unable to finish his work.

Jimin would be lying if he said it did not affect him. When he heard the girls moan, his brain didn’t do enough to prevent him from imagining his Master thrusting, fucking, debauching—with that same stern face he usually sent Jimin’s way. The same look of disapproval. Jimin’s knees would turn weak, his face pale where he caught it in the mirror of the washroom, as he saw the walls shake with the effort of fornication. He’d close his eyes then and see his Master behind the pressed shut lids: tall, handsome, and brooding—over him, forceful, strong; all muscle. He’d clamp a hand over his mouth through a whimper, feeling himself clench and heat up at his imagination, his prick nudging needy against the fabric of his pants, his head recalling back to thoughts of bath water and the imprint of his Master’s hot manhood in his mouth.

Then came the anguish and shame, his pathetic body not ever worthy of someone like the young Master, who would never touch him, let alone look at him with any form of interest or more than the warmth of a finger trailing a speck of dust. Jimin hid in his sleeping chamber under the blanket some nights, when he could not sleep from the noise, biting the cotton of his nightgown and pressing a warm hand against his flush member, crying to himself as softly as he could, so as not to wake his parents. The tears streamed down in frustration, guilt, and pleasure, the image of the young Master’s cold eyes on him making him release into his sheets with barely any friction.

He carried himself with much amplified shame the next day, more so than the girl of the week, who always seemed less spent and more lax in the clothing department as she sauntered around the manor the next morning, acting as if the young Master had all but proposed and offered to start their new, fruitful life together.

The only good thing about those situations was that the young Master, despite his flirtatious ways, or perhaps because of it, did not pay the girls much mind the next day, or any time thereafter. He had had his fill, and he made it abundantly clear, much to their chagrin. He was back to his bored, apathetic demeanor come breakfast time, poking at his food with disinterest. Oh, how the girls lamented this. How they would frown and sulk and send their doe eyes his way, vying for attention. Jimin was ashamed to admit he did not sympathize with them.

One day, while cleaning the young Master’s bedroom after a particularly fun night he had had with a girl from a southern county, he spotted something in his Master’s bed, tucked next to the pillows. As it was his duty to clean, naturally, he had checked up on the intrusion, wanting to make sure his Master’s bedroom was spotless, with not a thing out of place.

When he pulled it out, he realized what it was. Jimin took the stay into his hands, admiring the rigid, boned structure—for around the rib area—and the softer, crinkled cups for the breasts. The material was soft; pretty. It was the whitest white he had ever seen, and he knew something so white and so soft could only come from somebody with a wealth of money and influence.

He held it up against his own chest, trying to understand the workings of it. It was small, but so was he, the lace bits looking like it might fit snugly around his waist. Oh, how small their waists were, the girls. He imagined them putting these on in the morning, with a chambermaid to help them string it taut.

“Admiring my trophy?” A brooding voice sounded paces away from him.

Jimin felt his blood run cold, dropping the stay as if burned. He looked up, his Master standing the the entryway of his room, one hand holding a cup of wine, undoubtedly stolen from the kitchen, and the other holding the door handle. His face was expressionless, his eyes mildly curious.

“I’m sorry, I—“

“Well, try it on, then,” Master Jungkook said, placing his cup of wine on his night table as he wandered further in, closing the door behind himself. “That’s what you were going to do, weren’t you?” He challenged, eyeing the fabric on the bed.

“No, I...” Jimin swallowed thickly around nothingness, his head feeling light at the thought of wearing the garment. Never had he ever imagined...never should he ever have even touched something like that. Been on his Master’s bed. Soiled his sheets.

“That’s the finest thing your filthy body will ever have near it, so take your chance before I retract my offer.”

Not sure what else to do, Jimin reached for the stay with shaky hands, pulling at the strings of it and shuffling off the bed. Jungkook said nothing, just watching him fumble around as he looked down at the stay. He held it up near his armpits again, looking Jungkook’s way with heated cheeks.

“It goes under your shirt,” Jungkook drawled, lazily observing his poor attempts to fulfil the Master’s request.

Jimin yanked at his shirt, pulling it off over his head quickly and fitting the stay around his ribs the best he could. It was a little scratchy, not as soft as it had looked initially. Perhaps karma for him. It scratched at him as he wrestled it on, fitting snugly against his ribs.

“It’s clearly an undergarment,” Master Jungkook continued to mumble, scoffing. “Remove your pants.”

Halfway done with lacing it up his torso, Jimin hesitated again, eyeing his Master to gauge whether he was serious or not. His Master was unblinking, unyielding with his words. He fisted the hem of his pants carefully, holding his breath before pulling them down. The stay cups around his chest tickled against his skin as he bent over, kicking his pants off and exposing himself in the nude.

This had to be a new form of humiliating disciplinary action young Master Jungkook seemed fitting for his crime. He stared at the floor, unable to look his Master in the eyes as soon as he stood exposed, his skin prickling head to toe in goosebumps. All he could feel was the material of the frilly undergarment and the hammering of his lovelorn heart in his chest, rattling the silk and frills.

“You can go now.”

Jimin looked up, his Master making his way towards his bed, resuming what he seemed to have been doing before spotting Jimin in his way. Jimin covered his bits the best he could, willing his flush to go down and his face to return to its normal colour as he tried to move. But every time the Master spoke, every stern word and piercing look, he couldn’t help but feel more worked up; more useless and unable to think. All he could do was swallow and breathe shallowly to mitigate the effects, but his palms remained clammy, his skin buzzing with heat.

The young Master looked down his body from his bed as he realized he still had not left, over his flushed chest, his tense limbs, and down to his revealing nether region, all of which Jimin was trying and failing to cover with his arms and hands. He could feel beads of sweat run down his back, his knees trembling.

The young Master smirked, sending a ripple of shame through Jimin’s body as he spotted it. He panted where he stood, worrying his eyebrows and wishing he could be swallowed whole by the floor.

“Did you perhaps hear us last night and wish it was you I was fucking into the mattress in a pretty dress?” Master Jungkook asked, voice discernibly flat and void of emotion as he stood still and stared at Jimin from his spot near the bed.

Jimin’s eyes widened in horror, cock twitching involuntarily as he clenched his thighs. Hearing his Master say that made him positively dizzy. He didn’t know what to do with himself. He could never lie to his Master, but was it worse to reveal his shameful, most lowly thoughts?

“Well?” Master Jungkook pushed, crossing his arms, as if impatient. His tone was so deep; demanding. Jimin continued to suck in constricted breaths, staring at the floor and his toes. “Am I correct, Jimin?”

“I-I would never, Master,” he mumbled out, chewing on his flimsy lie as he tried to make himself smaller. “I would never presume or even think to think of you that way,” he lied in an even hastier mumble, eyes anywhere but near the young Master. He curled forward, so ashamed he thought he might die. He thought he might have gotten away with it when he heard silence, but the young Master was nothing if not patient for the sake of humiliation.

“I don’t like liars,” Master Jungkook said calmly, his eyes still fixed on Jimin’s nether region. He walked forwards ever so slowly, reaching a hand out and pinching the invisible breast in the frilly stay cup, fingers closing around nothing but air and fabric. Jimin whimpered, despite nothing having happened. Then he flushed due to his weak, reactionary instinct. “Did you touch your tiny prick at night, whining at the thought of getting your Master’s cock?” Master Jungkook’s eyes were so intense, Jimin thought he might faint. His nipple tingled, despite being a good measure away from the Master’s actual fingers. It was as if he could feel the phantom of it from afar, touching him in theory. Only the young Master could do this, make his skin ripple with goosebumps without even touching him. Make him out of breath despite having available to him all of the oxygen he could desire. Control his every move with barely a mustered breath of forthright command. “Are you jealous of the girls, Jimin?”

Jimin shook his head in horror, thinking of how the Mister and Mistress of the house would punish him if they knew. That he imagined himself out of his station. His place. What he imagined of their son. Their youngest. His dirty, lowly, clumsy self, in the deepest, darkest crevices of his mind.

“I’m not—I’m not,” Jimin whined hastily, closing his eyes so his Master could not affect him anymore. He knew he was not worthy; that he disgusted the young Master and had no place holding fantasies akin to those of the pretty, high-born girls. He knew Master Jungkook might never want to look at him or speak to him again.

He heard the floorboard creak, Master Jungkook walking away towards the bed. Jimin dared to open his eyes and watched confused as his Master moved on top of the bed, crawling up to the headboard. He turned around, sitting with his legs lazily in front of him, and staring at Jimin expectantly, eyes half-lidded. His black hair almost blended into the stained wooden headboard, his eyes piercing and bright in the otherwise dim room. Jimin tried to spend a moment not focused on himself; how he was feeling exposed, vulnerable, and utterly spent. Master Jungkook was supposed to be his one and only care. His point of fixation and attention. The person he put all his love and effort into. Made his hands bleed for; served to the point of exhaustion.

“Are you going to show the girls how you can ride me, too?” Was said almost quietly into the empty room.

Jimin looked behind himself out of instinct. Surely, Master Jungkook was not speaking to him. To him, lowly as he was. Surely, he was dreaming. He must have hit his head while cleaning. He must have fainted while going out into the winter air, trekking for food or wood. His father must have beat the life out of him for being the stupidest, most pitiful son in the world, until his blood ran red and thick down the sewage drains. Unequivocally, this could not be real.

Jimin blinked, opening and closing his mouth as he held Master Jungkook’s gaze out of respect and the innate desire to serve. Jungkook regarded him back, though he seemed to be growing in impatience at the lack of response.

“M-Master?” he tried into the darkness, confused and feeling like he was hysterical, having lost his mind entirely.

“Should I try a boy’s pussy too, Jimin?” Master Jungkook pressed, face unwavering as he spoke such lewd words, still holding Jimin’s gaze with those unforgiving eyes. Jimin faltered, taking a half step forward and sputtering as his learned desire to respond to everything his Master said died in his short-circuited throat.

Master Jungkook kept his stare cold and unwavering, lip quirked up ever so slightly as he reached into his pants and fished out his cock, thick and angry red from what Jimin could tell as it emerged from the weighty material. He could do nothing but stare, eyes following the curved, bulbed flesh as it bobbed out of his clothing.

“Master,” Jimin whined, suddenly feeling so desperate and needy, his Master’s beautiful, handsome face observing him from so close. He had such a longing urge to be held by him, by his strong hands. To hear him say his name again. Just once. As if he was worthy of being in his Master’s mouth.

He willed his legs forward hesitantly, shuffling over to the bed, all the while Jungkook observed him carefully. He climbed on the bed, arms shaking. Master Jungkook didn’t move, waiting for him to get in place. Jimin swiftly situated himself onto Master Jungkook’s lower thighs, feeling his legs tremble, too. He wasn’t sure what to do. His imagination and his training only took him so far, but he was still ignorant to the ways of the world, of men. Of women.

“Oh, M-Master, I...“ He forced himself to stop over-thinking, and reached his arms out to hesitantly wrap around his Master’s sturdy neck panting pathetic breaths between them as they were suddenly so much closer. It put his mind into overdrive. This was the longest his Master had gone without punishing him. Without handling him with a stern grip, a punishing shove, or a painful boot. And he felt drunk on it.

Unable to stop the giddy feeling in his chest from taking over his body, he propelled himself forward and closed the space between him and his handsome Master, the only person he looked up to in this world. His lips landed on unmoving ones, his eyes closing blissfully as he allowed himself the most selfish, terrible indulgence of his life.

Then, he felt pressure around his throat, eyes flying open to see the terrible anger on his Master’s face, his Master’s hand closed around him.

“Don’t presume to put your filthy mouth on me,” Jungkook spat, wiping his lips with his shirt, as if on purpose, to make Jimin feel worse, clearly disgusted. Jimin panicked, then. How could he have done something so reckless? So revolting? To assume his Master would want him, of all people, touching him. Jimin, who was born from dirt and lived in it, hands and body sallow with serfdom and the pestilence of uncleanliness.

“Forgive me—” he began in a choke, tears spilling down his cheeks at the betrayal of his station. He’d been selfish, thinking his Master would want him in that way. Of course he would not. Of course. He did not have the pretty, white skin the highborn, foreign girls had, with their pinched, rosen cheeks; their long, bouncy hair.

He was nothing.

Master Jungkook shoved him back by his chokehold, flipping them over as he pushed Jimin backwards into the mattress, pinning his wrists above his head.

“We both know you would look pathetic trying to ride me,” Jungkook whispered into his ear, venomously, his grip on his wrists unwavering. “You cannot cook, you cannot clean—so what makes you think you would ever be able to bring me pleasure?”

Jimin failed to stifle a moan, jolts of arousal thrumming all through his body. He realized his Master must have figured out how cruel words left him pitifully breathless and wanton. He hated it, but was desperate enough to lay still and take it, aching for any touch; any scrap of attention. His Master’s spiteful words. To be punished for his insolence. Told he was worthless.

“Master,” he mumbled dumbly, face turned away to the side as he let his body go limp, waiting for Master Jungkook to touch him anywhere, to move or grind down. His face was wet, tears blurring his vision as he tried to see and make sense of what might happen next. He was so overwhelmed he did not know what to do with himself. “Please, please...”

“Shut up.”

He felt one of his Master’s rough, large hands trace down his waist and thigh, gripping the flesh there. He moaned at the touch, but felt himself tremble, too. He had never been touched there. Only in his fantasies. Only by his lonesome, tucked away in his cot. And to think his Master would be the first to touch him there—

He turned his head away, biting his lip. Master Jungkook finally let go of his remaining wrist, only to stick two fingers deep into his mouth. Jimin gurgled, breathing out of his nose instead. His Master’s other hand resumed it’s groping, before he travelled a teasing finger down to the crack of Jimin’s ass cheeks, rubbing the sensitive skin there. Jimin whimpered, twitching under his ministrations. His Master’s eyes lit up in attention, eyeing him curiously.

“Have you taken anyone in before?” His Master demanded, halting his rubbing. Jimin almost bucked his hips up at the loss of friction. He could only assume his Master was speaking of how he’d speared the girls on his cock.

Jimin shook his head, salivating and gurgling dumbly around the fingers in his mouth. He’d never taken a cock. Not that there was anyone around to offer. Master Jungkook smirked, pressing the pad of his thumb against Jimin’s hole. And Jimin keened, twitching involuntarily.

“Good. I would not touch damaged goods.”

Before he knew it, the fingers in his mouth were pulled out and trailed down past his tiny, stiff prick that was weeping against his stomach, all the way down to his most private place, nestling wetly between the mounds there.

“O-Oh...”

One finger breached in, slipping inside easily. Jimin covered his face with his hands to hide his blushing and so he would not see, almost biting the inside of his palms. He felt a second one join soon after, stretching him wider. His Master spit down. The squelching was horrendous, his bottom clenching around the moving digits inside him desperately.

“Look at it, Jimin,” Master Jungkook commanded, making Jimin flinch. A hand slapped away his, before reaching for his hair and yanking him up by it, folding Jimin almost over himself as his back was practically lifted up from the bed and bent over. “Watch me fuck your pussy with my fingers.”

Jimin stared down, his Master’s thick digits disappearing and plunging in and out of his stretched entrance, wet with spit. The sound of his Master’s palm slapping against the skin of his bottom while his fingers copulated with him was sickeningly loud, and one glance at his Master’s face told him this was purposeful.

The stretch was erotic, but painful. Jimin’s fingers were so much smaller. Knowing his Master had his fingers lodged deep inside of him was enough to make Jimin almost faint, sweat gathering on his upper lip as he could barely do anything but whine and tremble, his scalp aching from the iron grip Master Jungkook still had in his hair.

“Looks like it’s ready for me, wouldn’t you say?” Master Jungkook suggested, admiring his work and finally letting go of Jimin’s hair. Jimin was tingling all over, mostly his scalp and his hole that Jungkook had just pulled out of. He lay there limp, chest swelling again at the thought of being used. He could barely breathe as he thought of his Master sheathed inside him, stuffing him full.

“Take me, Master. Anything—I want to give it to you,” he mumbled into the sheets, body limp as Master Jungkook touched his thigh.

“How cute that you’re offering,” his Master said sarcastically, scratching nails down his thigh as he smiled slightly off-kilter.

He flipped Jimin onto his front with only one strong hand. Jimin’s stiff cock was trapped against the mattress, aching for touch or movement. He felt a heavy weight on his thighs, hands pressing down on the small of his waist. His Master’s hot tongue licked up his nape, making Jimin whine in satisfaction. His Master’s heavy, warm member rested between Jimin’s cheeks.

Then, a stinging slap was delivered to his bottom, making it shake under the impact. A hand was on his head, shoving it down, and one pulling his hips up. The wetness around his hole was stroked by the fat head of his Master’s member, prodding at his winking entrance.

It was prodding and sliding until suddenly it was pushing in, wrestling with the tightness of Jimin’s panicking sphincter.

“O-Ow,” Jimin whined, hating himself for complaining when this was all he had ever wanted. He wanted to be good, to be the best. He bet the girls didn’t whine all pitiful and weak like him when his Master seared himself inside them. They always sounded so glad, so shameless. Lively. He had to be better. He needed to be better.

He bit his lips together hard, digging his forehead into the sheets. Once the first part was in, his Master fed in the rest, stretching Jimin open so wide he almost forgot how to breathe. He gasped into the sheets, thighs trembling at the breach. His brain felt numb, his fantasies of this moment coming nothing close to how it was. He cried out into the sheets, trying to muffle himself as he reminded himself he was supposed to not cause a fuss. The stretch was painful but euphoric, snuffing out the last voice of reason and rational thought from his head. All he could do was lay there and cry out like some stuck pig, body spasming just at the feeling of Master Jungkook seated still inside his body.

“How does it feel to serve your Master properly?” Master Jungkook asked, gripping his waist with a punishing hold, but his breath and nose moving almost gently up his neck.

“G-Good,” Jimin gurgled to himself, no sooner had he said it had Master Jungkook begun moving, thrusting into his slick bottom while using his hands on his waist to slam them together.

Jimin whined continuously, neck perched at an uncomfortable angle, but his body too weak to move, held down by Jungkook’s punishing thrusts.

“You think this dirty, sloppy hole will satisfy me anything like the warm, velvety cunts from France?” the young Master commented.

“N-No...” Jimin whined. He wept silently into his hands, his doubts confirmed as he felt himself be rocked and used carelessly, his Master’s distaste having been made apparent. He just wanted to be good for him. All his moments dreaming of this embrace, hopelessly thinking his Master might find use and desire for him. That he could be better than those silly girls. The ones who just ran around and were loud. Rude. Careless with their things and demanding. He wanted to be better. Softer, sweeter, more obedient. And he wanted his Master to love it.

“Jiminnie’s sorry,” he cried through a hiccup, muffled by the sheets. Jungkook stilled behind him, eerily silent. “He’s sorry—he will try better,” he continued, well aware that ‘trying better’ wouldn’t make his hole any nicer for his Master or make him any less filthy and a worse alternative to the better pleasures his master could afford. There seemed to almost be hesitation behind him, even the hands on his back oddly light.

Then, he was flipped over on his back again, his Master’s cock staying inside of him as he was turned around by a hand on his leg.

“You’ll just have to do,” his Master grunted, face expressionless.

He began thrusting again, this time caging his elbows on either side of Jimin’s head. Overwhelmed by their closeness, Jimin almost stopped breathing. He could feel tears running down the sides of his face, his mouth now salivating as his little prick was awakened again against his stomach, itching and hurting to release.

“Master,” Jimin said breathily, happily, closing his eyes and letting the stretch of his Master’s cock bring him closer to the edge, his eyes locking with him.

A stinging slap was delivered to his face for his insolence, his greediness. It burned. Now he was facing the wall, cheek burning a criminal red.

But they were so close. His Master was still willingly leaning so close over him, that he could almost feel his breath dance over his skin in little rivulets. Decorate him in ripples at the ecstasy of the feathery-light touch.

Jimin reached his arms up blindly, his lips feeling cold and lonely, as he dreamed of feeling his Master’s warm lips on his again. Master Jungkook seemed to halt in a slight hesitation, watching Jimin practically demand something from him so blatantly. Jimin regretted it almost as soon as he had done it, his Master’s eyes hardening.

“Did you try to touch me again?” he sneered, yanking Jimin’s arms away to the side. Jimin yelped in surprise. “You take what I give you. I decide what you deserve.”

“I-I love—”

“Filthy pig,” Jungkook cut him off with, leaning his head down next to his shoulder as he thrust hard and fast, one of his large hands coming up to cover Jimin’s breathy mouth. Jimin lay still and took the punishing thrusts, body rocked back and forth violently until his Master stilled with a grunt, fingers clasping hard around his mouth. Jimin whimpered, feeling something hot and sticky fill him up. His own cock sputtered pathetically against his stomach, leaking over his navel and lower abdomen. His Master still had his head rested at the side of his nape, in the sheets, breathing deeply.

“M-Master? Are you okay?” Jimin tried, small hands reaching up to support his Master’s shoulders with a light touch.

“Do not be obtuse,” Master Jungkook grunted, slapping his hands away. He pulled back, unseating himself from inside Jimin as well with a wet slip. The emptiness Jimin felt inside his body was overwhelming. Master Jungkook seemed to smirk at his disappointed expression. “Get out. I’m done with you.”

Jimin, limbs turned jelly, breathed hard to himself where he lay, the softness of the sheets under him laughing cruelly at his sweaty back. He did not belong there. He was an intruder. He whimpered, his face still stinging as he tried to sit up with shaky arms.

“Did you not hear me?” Master Jungkook growled, already far away from him as he moved off the bed, reaching for his clothing and pulling them on. Jimin flinched. “Are you deaf? Or just unintelligent?”

He frowned while he watched his Master dress himself, holding his arms over his chest and nether region, suddenly feeling extremely bare. His Master noticed, laughing at him.

“Oh, do not presume yourself shy now.” Master Jungkook leaned forward and grabbed his arm, effectively pulling him off the bed. Jimin let himself be yanked up, trying his best to will his muscles to keep him upright. “Were you not all but ready to be my consummated wife mere seconds ago? Love of my life?”

Jimin blushed, feeling nauseous with embarrassment. He had not meant for it to come out. It had just slipped. He had been so overwhelmed with it, so taken in the heat of the moment, that he had not been able to distinguish his brain from his vocal chords; his mouth from his thoughts.

Jimin kept silent, the strong hold keeping him up as he was pulled over the floor, barely able to walk to keep up as his Master moved towards a new location. His sweaty skin stung with the damp coolness he now felt moving through the room. Master Jungkook marched a shaky Jimin out into the hallway, heading south. Jimin whimpered, shuffling after him and trying his best to cover himself. The more they walked, the more Jimin realized they were headed towards the kitchens, Jimin able to feel his face and rear still globbed with streaks of release as they made their way there.

“Master,” he breathed, still shaky and out of it, but knowing he would follow his Master anywhere; do whatever he asked of him. That would not, however, stop him from feeling petrified, close to freezing in place, his head hurting with the inability to protest.

“Time to clean the dishes,” Master Jungkook ordered, making him stumble as they rounded a corner, the silent halls reminding Jimin that the estate was fast asleep.

“M-Master—” Jimin startled, more panicked now. He recognized their route, seeing familiar halls as they made their way down the stairs towards quarters he was more familiar with. Master Jungkook’s expression was neutral when Jimin caught glimpses of it, but his hold was hard and unforgiving around Jimin’s wrist.

Sooner than Jimin would have liked, they rounded the door to the kitchens, close to where his parents rested in their cot. Jimin clasped a hand over his mouth as he gasped, his mind whirring as he realized his naked state and the loud banging of Master Jungkook shoving the kitchen door open.

“Were you not trying to be better?” Jungkook asked, sensing his hesitation. Jimin knew he was used to unwavering obedience. Jimin had given him that. He wanted to always give him that. But here... “Were you not trying to be your best? I’m not happy, Jimin.”

“Master,” Jimin pleaded, one of the only times he had done so. He could feel his chest constrict in apprehension, his hands going clammy. His naked form was on display, soiled body parts and all. He could barely breathe, watching his Master watch him with crossed arms, as if waiting for something. He glanced over to the closed door of the servants’ quarters, unable to look away or focus on his Master wholeheartedly.

“You do not want Mommy and Daddy to know you’ve serviced me? Would they not be so proud of you, Jimin?” Master Jungkook challenged, giving him a pitying look. Jimin looked to the side to check for a cloth or towel to cover himself with. He blushed furiously, feeling his eyes wet again.

Jimin shook his head hard, holding it low so as to not aggravate his Master any further.

“No? Would they sigh and think, ‘even my dumb, little Jimin would not be stupid enough to turn himself into a household whore’?”

Jimin hunched his shoulders as he cried, the cruel words expected but hitting him harder somehow now, for whatever reason. He fought the urge to crawl to the young Master’s feet, settling for throwing his face into his hands instead, shoulders shaking as he tried to balance his shame with his sorrow, alongside the strings of fear and dormant arousal that licked their way up his spine.

“Jungkook.”

The both of them turned at the sudden new voice in the dim kitchen, shocked still. Master Namjoon stood at the turn of the corridor, face hard as he only eyed his brother, unwavering even for a moment. Jungkook, for the first time Jimin had observed him, looked surprised—apprehensive, even—as his older brother breached the scene, stepping purposeful steps into the room.

“Mother’s asking for you,” Namjoon simply said, having yet to blink as he fixed his gaze upon his brother. Jimin supposed he was grateful Master Namjoon was not looking at him. He did not know if he could handle anyone else seeing him in this state. Seeing what had become of him.

“No she isn’t,” Jungkook shot back. Jimin just shifted his weight from one leg to the other, his skin itching as Jungkook’s and his release dried with his sweat, his tears also pricking a tightening dryness against his cheeks and chin.

“You want to test that theory?” Namjoon pressed, voice deeper now. Jimin could see the hesitation in young Master Jungkook’s body out of the corner of his eyes, though he forced himself to keep his gaze low, now resting somewhere near Master Namjoon’s feet.

An angry grunt ruptured into the room, Jimin flinching at the loudness of it. Namjoon did not waver. Following soon after, Jimin heard the telltale sound of Master Jungkook storming out of the kitchens, leaving behind a painful, awkward silence. Jimin swallowed dryly, wringing his fingers together in front of him. Master Namjoon must have seen him by now. Must have looked at him. Seen the mess he was, the disgrace. The wickedness he’d done.

A gentle hand rested on top of his head, patting his hair. The cold fingers run through his sweaty, warm scalp. It was soothing. Jimin flinched out of habit, before relaxing into the touch.

“Come on, Jimin. I’ll clean you up.”

Namjoon used a gentle hand to help Jimin into his personal bath on the second floor. The smaller did not object, allowing Namjoon to guide him in and use the lukewarm water to clean him. The boy’s face was a little vacant; a little out of it. Aloof. Namjoon hoped some gentle touches might bring him back to a normal state. He was docile, but not out of petrification. He seemed almost calm; resigned to swimming in his nakedness and feeling any touch that came his way.

Namjoon’s eyes trailed down Jimin’s figure as he washed him up, running the cloth over the reddened, harshly grabbed parts of his pale skin. When his eyes got to Jimin’s backside he blushed, averting his gaze ever so slightly to give him his modesty. He tried to clean him as best as he could, avoiding that area until it was all that was left.

Raw and slick. That was etched in his mind. When he’d first observed it in the kitchen. It had been relatively apparent what had transpired. At least physically. Namjoon had heard suspicious sounds from outside in the halls as he’d wandered to retire back in his bedchambers from his study. Seeing faint figures moving down the hall after a scuffle, he’d hurried to survey the scene.

“Master,” Jimin said, in a voice so subservient and willing that Namjoon had to pull his hand away to feel less weird about cleaning him up.

“Alright, Jimin. All done,” he said with a smile, patting him on the head again. He tried to be gentle, forcing his voice to be equally so. He wanted Jimin to know he was trustworthy. A good man, compared to his little brother. That not everybody in that household was out to get the small servant. “Are you hurting?”

Jimin nodded solemnly, but it was a resigned hurt, rather than a sharp one. A peculiar hurt.

“Where are you hurting?” He urged, not sure he wanted to hear the answer.

Jimin took Namjoon’s hand in his, guiding it down his clavicle, until it landed on his chest, right over his beating heart. Namjoon stirred uncomfortably where he sat bent over the bathtub.

“It hurts?” He asked skeptically. Jimin nodded gravely, movements slow and dazed.

“What about your...what about...” Namjoon made a gesture to his behind, feeling himself go even redder. Jimin shook his head sincerely, clutching Namjoon’s hand tighter. Namjoon almost jerked in surprise.

“Now when I go to bed, I can still feel him with me.”

He stared at the still water around Jimin’s still body, the curves of his thighs and ribs bending under the water and distorting him. Jimin’s chest was flushed.

“You like that?” Namjoon asked, sceptical. He tried to use his gaze to pry open Jimin’s mind, looking hard into his eyes and near his mouth, waiting for something to betray his words. For the real truth to reveal itself, or for an unmistakable detail to come forward.

“My Master is everything to me,” Jimin confirmed, as if Jungkook had trained him to respond that way himself.

“R-Right...” Namjoon said, accepting it for what it was, but unable to set aside his large helping of worry and distaste. “Next time he...next time Jungkook, uh—tries to do something unsavory...you let me know.”

“Why?” Jimin asked, eyes genuinely curious. As if they had not witnessed violence together. Abuse of power. The knowing marks and the weird, obsessive behaviour. The shift in Jimin’s demeanor. Like they were innocent to the ways in which he’d been treated.

“That is an order, Jimin,” Namjoon settled for saying, hating himself for it as soon as he did so. Jimin’s eyes widened, clearly computing the reconfiguration of Namjoon’s status in his head. The hierarchy reimposed on him even when Namjoon had worked so hard to break it down. He had not meant it to be hurtful. But things were getting out of hand. Jungkook was out of hand. Jimin needed to have an out in case things got too bad. He could not directly grab Jimin from Jungkook, because the younger would throw a fit that was fit for a revolution. He could, however, ruin Jungkook’s hold around his newfound ‘toy’. Little by little, with careful and purposeful presses of Jimin in the right direction.

“Yes, Master,” Jimin said, his voice more habitual sounding than before. And Namjoon would take that over another event like this again any day.

The next time Jungkook fucked Jimin he was not so gentle, but Jimin was also not so scared. Jungkook saw it in his face, how accepting and resigned he was. No matter what Jungkook did, what he gave him or took from him, Jimin would look up at him with that look on his face that made Jungkook’s insides burn with desire alongside a spurring for him to act worse. Begging for him to tighten the noose of control until it was choking; deadly.

“You’re not presentable,” Jungkook spat, grabbing a chunk of Jimin’s hair and holding him up by it so that his neck was awkwardly bent. Jimin’s eyes were half-lidded in pleasure and a deep seated acquiescence, all his muscles lax as he laid himself bare for Jungkook to take, his face almost serene with a childish longing.

Jungkook fucked Jimin hard, grabbing a shearing knife he’d kept by his night table for a few weeks and running it along his grip, a small chunk of Jimin’s hair coming off as he cut it with a grunt. He was agitated, for some reason. And Jimin’s serene expression and obedience made it worse.

“I’m sorry, Master,” Jimin whispered, almost smiling up at him through the hairs that rained down on his face and around him on the sheets.

“Did Master Namjoon say something to you?” Jungkook pressed, trying to get to the root of his frustration. He scanned Jimin’s body as if he would find the answer there. “Has he ordered you to do something?” He kept thrusting, but stilled after a few seconds, trying to make his servant speak. He was bad at conversing or courteous human interaction, so this was already a challenge for him. “You can tell me,” he added, sickeningly gentle for his usual demeanor. He would have to be if he were to efficiently pry the clamming boy open enough to get his secrets out of him. To give him dirt on his brother, of whatever stupid games he was scheming. Jungkook would win them, of course. Jimin was his game, and Namjoon wouldn’t know how to play him even if he tried. “Whisper it to me, Jimin. That’s an order.”

Jungkook leaned down over the boy, risking the smaller’s clammy hands wrapping around him and his face getting uncomfortably close to get the ripe and ecstatic pleasure of Jimin speaking everything Namjoon had ever said to him right into his ear, filling him up with the insolence; the betrayal, and the meddling that had been planned and intended right under his nose.

Jungkook had coaxed it out of him, sweet and prying as a child looking to hold a toy, but he had never promised Jimin compassion or forgiveness for sharing the tale of betrayal, willing as he was.

And so that was not what Jimin found waiting for him after his last breath of explanation, either.

The morning found Jimin out on the grounds by the horse stalls, crying. Three of their animals—his animals—had gone missing through the night. Most telling was a trail of white feathers, following a beaten path down to a river, streaks of blood murking up the soil underneath it until the river bank. He cried in earnest, gasping and wailing as he scooped up the feathers, lamenting his dead goose, and trying not to think on the open stall and the broken leash in its periphery wake.

He considered Master Jungkook’s angry dog—the bullish, boorish one always growling and jumping around the outhouse—who was trained for hunting. Were he to find it quietly satiated and with a bloodstained mouth at the helms of the property, he would not be surprised, and he would also not reprimand it. But that did not mean it did not hurt. That he was unable to feel the loss and grief, just because he believed he deserved it.

Namjoon and Jungkook were the only two attendees showing for supper anymore, and even they were reluctant to come. Did their stomachs not growl and their eyes not ache from seeing the same four walls of their room every day, they might not have made the trip downstairs to mingle in the dining room. Considering neither of them were particularly excited to see the other, it only made the meal that much more tense and unnerving, amplified to the hundredths when Jimin walked into the room to take their plates away after their satiation.

When the servant realized it was only the two young Masters in the room, he quickly scurried back out as soon as he had the plates in hand, face looking pale as a ghost. Something about him had looked different, too. Namjoon glanced at Jungkook, whom he had not spoken to the entire meal, training his eyes onto his face, then his collar, and trailing down to his arms and his one fisted palm. Namjoon swallowed hard, feeling overly full from the meal he had taken but three bites of.

“Jungkook, look at yourself,” Namjoon started in a whisper, the words borne and dying in his mouth as he forced his lips to move. “You’re obsessed,” he croaked finally, eyeing what looked like chunks of a few locks of hair in between his little brother’s fingers. “You’re unhinged.”

“I’m perfectly hinged,” Jungkook said calmly, dropping the hair onto the table with little preamble, and making to take a sip of wine from his cup. From his father’s cup.

Namjoon took the napkin off of his collar, placing it gently down on the tablecloth while observing the way his brother sat in thought. He had never felt so unsettled by just being in his presence.

“That’s not a word,” Namjoon said, placing his hand down on the table for leverage. It used to mean that his words had weight. At one point, Jungkook had respected him, to whatever extent. His age and his position had meant something. Now, with their parents aloof, depressed, or bathing in degeneracy, he did not have the family armour to fall back on. It was just Jungkook’s will against his own. Just his brother teetering on the edge of a cliff he could not come back from and Namjoon feeling powerless to stop it.

“And you’re no doctor,” Jungkook rebutted, raising his eyebrows. He was amused. Namjoon bristled, but kept his mouth shut, not sure what he could possibly have squeezed out of his throat to talk sense rather than anger into his devilish little brother.

He had used to think it was only entitlement. The young soul spoiled by his mother’s attention and the riches lavishing everything from the threads in their garments to the floor they walked on. But now, sitting opposite Jungkook in the dim room they used to sit in as a family together, Namjoon felt apprehension. Disgust. Stupor. Jungkook seemed to grow annoyed with his staring in silence, slamming his cup down on the table.

“If you pester me or my servant one more time, or try to get involved,” Jungkook started, leaning closer to Namjoon over the table. A few locks of his long, dark her fell forward into his face as he did so. Namjoon kept his gaze, unblinking. Refusing to show fright. “I will ruin everything he loves until he is miserable, save for the select morsels of attention he gets from me.” Jungkook, too remaining unblinking, his eyes looking like giant, black vortex pools of emptiness. Namjoon watched his rigid mouth move around his words, his face betraying no emotion one way or another. “And then, I will ruin him. I will break him.”

Namjoon frowned, feeling his palms clam up with sweat. His chest burned with objection. With distaste and disarray at Jungkook’s complete lack of self-awareness.

“You already have,” Namjoon told him. Jungkook seemed to consider what he had said for a second, for the first time since they were younger looking like he was listening to what Namjoon was saying and not having it go in one ear and out the other. Jungkook raised an eyebrow, smiling to himself. Namjoon felt a violent repulsion ripple through him.

“And he likes it, the dumb mutt,” Jungkook confirmed, stroking the tablecloth with his index finger carefully. He seemed to muse on that with elation, each scratch of his finger against the fabric of the cloth rendering Namjoon more and more on edge. “Say,” the brat continued, looking up at him with inquisitive eyes that mimicked imploring curiosity. “I’m wondering if Father would be interested in knowing why you haven’t found a wife to bear a child yet,” Jungkook mused over the edge of his cup as he took a sip, continuing to play with the pattern on the tablecloth with his fingers.

Namjoon swallowed hard, tightening his hands into fists under the table.

“And why would that be, Jungkook?”

His little brother quirked his lip up even more, seeming enthralled by the unwavering attention he was receiving.

“I think it’s pretty obvious why you’re so insistent on sticking your nose into my sex life,” Jungkook laughed, shoving his half-full wine glass over so that the contents spilled out over the tablecloth, running in a splattered but straight line, soaking right over to Namjoon’s side, before dripping down onto his trousers. “Well? Am I right, you impotent freak?”

Namjoon, having had more than enough, promptly got up and left the room.

“Fetch me my whiskey, Jimin,” young Master Jungkook said from his perch in the armrest near the fireplace.

He had been different lately, but Jimin could not pinpoint exactly how. All he knew was that he couldn’t remember the last time he had served the Master or Mistress of the house. Young Master Jungkook seemed to seek to monopolize his time, now existing at every turn Jimin made as he tried to fulfil his duties around the estate. It was not like it was out of character for him to put his Master’s requests above all the other ones. He could deal with reprimanding from his parents. But Jungkook had been more covert about it before. Now, Jimin almost lived at Jungkook’s heel, responding only to his voice. His head was dizzy with the attention. Giddy, distressed, and elated all at the same time, not sure why the shift had happened, or when, but relaxing and finding comfort under the stern holds or words flung his way.

“Yes, Sir,” he said with little preamble, making to head for the drinking cabinet. A sound behind him stopped him in his tracks, turning around at Master Jungkook’s voice.

“But,” the young Master clarified. “I do not think your legs are working very well right now. How very unfortunate.”

“What?” Jimin asked, looking down at his legs questioningly. There seemed to be working fine. Did Master Jungkook know something he did not?

Just as he thought that, Master Jungkook got up from the chair, walking over in his direction slowly, before kicking behind Jimin’s knees with great force. Jimin buckled, tumbling to the floor, his arms catching him before he planted face first. He looked back, his master seeming pleased with himself. Suddenly, a heavy boot pressed on his back, Jimin forced fully onto his hands and knees. The feeling was familiar, and Jimin let himself be pliant and ready, unsure of his direction but ready to take it.

“S-Sir?” He asked.

“Now, fetch me my whiskey,” Master Jungkook just said, pointing to the cabinet.

Jimin hesitated for a miniscule fraction of a second, getting used to the texture of the wood under his hands and the hard surface toying with his knees.

Then, he crawled.

Master Namjoon, though previously vocal about his objection to Jimin’s attachment to young Master Jungkook, had seemed to retreat to himself. Jimin would spot him in the halls sometimes, off doing Master Jungkook’s bidding, and the older heir would observe him almost callously, even when Jimin was decorated in bold bruises that had brought him euphoria just moments earlier. Master Namjoon, much like the Master and Mistress, seemed reclusive, or was downright absent from the manor altogether.

Which was why Jimin panicked one dark night when Master Namjoon showed up in Master Jungkook’s bedchambers, gazing at him with a look that was a far cry from the aloofness he had been sporting for weeks on end. He widened his eyes, glancing between Master Namjoon and the open door, well aware that his Master could return in at any time after finishing up his reading in the study.

“Master?” Jimin asked into the darkness, disturbed by the lack of action or vocalization on Master Namjoon’s part. Jimin sat up in his bed, pulling the sheets around his naked body. He wondered if Master Namjoon could see the stinging boot mark Jimin had received as a parting gift on his ear and jaw from the last time he’d been ordered to lick Master Jungkook’s boots, only to have ‘done it wrong’. A part of him was proud of it, having to hold himself back from reaching up to touch it to make sure it was still there. Even with the presence of a more senior Master of the house, Master Jungkook still distracted him with an unyielding grasp on his mind.

“How he treats you...it is not right,” Master Namjoon simply said, seeming cautious about how he meticulously chose his words. It was an odd thing to be saying into the silence of Master Jungkook’s and his bedchambers after having spoken no other words to him for months. Jimin grimaced, leaning back against the wall and pulling his sheets up further. Now he did not want Master Namjoon to see the marks. He would not appreciate them like Jimin did. He would misunderstand. He would cause trouble. “I think you would be better off providing your services elsewhere.”

“I wouldn’t,” Jimin protested loudly, too fast to play it off as a well-thought-out response. He glanced out the window with petrified eyes, thinking of being forced out there, away from his home. It was raining outside. He could not think of anywhere else he belonged; where he was needed. Surely, Master Namjoon could not mean that. He had not spoken to Jimin in months, so this must be an ill-thought accusation. Though he could tell Master Namjoon was not ordering him away directly, merely giving him sound advice. Advice, nonetheless, that he was immeasurably unwilling to take. “I do not think I would,” he corrected himself, trying to stay meek and obedient in the face of unwanted orders, unconsciously holding tight his Master’s bed sheets as if they would root him to the room and keep him there forever.

“Jimin,” Master Namjoon tried again, but Jimin would not hear it, for the first time in his short life interrupting a Master’s words.

“The young Master needs me,” he blurted out, saying it as if he were trying to convince himself, too. Master Jungkook had never said it, but it was not like he had asked for anyone else. Without Jimin, Master Jungkook would have no friends. No social interactions. Even the girls from France did not come around any longer. His Mother and Father had abandoned him. Master Jungkook was all alone in the world. Nobody understood him like Jimin did. Nobody cared. Not even his own brother. “He just needs some comfort. He’s lonely here.”

“That’s an order, Jimin,” Master Namjoon pressed, taking a step forward towards him. Jimin whimpered, flinching back. “You’re being made redundant.”

Jimin struggled to breathe, tears pooling in his eyes as he looked towards the door behind Master Namjoon. He shook his head slowly, keeping his eyes on that opening, his heart pounding in his chest. He had been born in the estate, and he did not know anything else. That was not a direct order from his true Master. Master Jungkook would never order him away. There were servants to take care of the rest of the estate, but Jimin took care of Master Jungkook. Jimin held him and took him and his wrath with his bare hands. It was the only thing he felt somewhat capable of doing. Forget his cooking, his cleaning, and his useless, unimproving skills. He knew how to serve his Master.

Jimin bolted out of bed, uncaring for his modesty, as he cowered away from Namjoon, shaky legs moving him towards the door. His head was throbbing with the adrenaline of going against an order, his cheeks already feeling wet from fear and hopelessness.

“Jimin!” He heard bellowed after him, something in his peripheral vision trying to reach for him as he moved. He screamed, side-stepping Namjoon as he sprinted out the door, his bare feet slapping against the floorboards. He ran down the stairs and past all the familiar rooms, not even stopping when his throat and chest burned from exertion and his thighs ached from strain. He ran faster than he had ever before, unable to think or look at himself as he disobeyed an order for the first time in his life.

However, if Master Namjoon relinquished him of his services, then Jimin was not obliged to follow his commands. There was only one person whose commands he would follow until that very mouth would command him to cease existence.

“Where were you last night?” Master Jungkook growled, a firm hand clasped around the top of his servant’s arm.

Jungkook had found him sitting behind the drinking cabinet in the morning, half hidden by the curtains of the windows. He looked horrible, cheeks clearly tear-stained and semi-naked body pressed flat and red against the side of the cabinet. When he had seen Jungkook walk in, he had cried even more, mumbling something Jungkook could not quite decipher along with Namjoon’s name.

Jungkook had seen red then, and dragged a half-naked and bumbling Jimin out of the manor, uncaring about whether or not his feet could keep up. He rolled his eyes at the whimpers behind him, and the desperate, sticky way the boy was holding at his hand and arm, as if scared he would leave him.

Jungkook dragged him down to the stables where the stable boys, gamekeepers, carpenters, and other men who served the house gathered in the mornings to hedge bets on fighting. He’d seen them some days; heard them. Loud and rowdy—pumped full of testosterone and wild with power and energy that they never got to express when working under him. Jungkook had considered telling on them to his parents, having them all fired or punished for their brutish insolence, but he’d kept the debauchery in the back of his mind, wondering if he could have fun with it one day.

And today was that day. His servant had been vile—clearly walking around without clothes on and making up excuses as to what had happened to him. None of them were correct, because Jungkook had taken Jimin’s shirts and thrown them around the estate to get him into trouble since he had run away from his room last night. And now he was angry that everyone was looking at his servant shirtless, even if it was his own fault. And the short, pitiful name of his brother on the servant’s lips rang in his mind vividly yet, occupying almost every space as he resented Jimin’s voice forming those sounds. Still, he needed to sate his anger. Needed to tell his servant that he could not just prance around like that, or leave him without notice. Because there were people in this world—lowly, brutish, angry people—who wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart. Who wouldn’t care for his needs.

When Jungkook reached the heavy stable door he saw Jimin stiffen up in fear, resisting his pulling movements for the first time that day. They both listened to the noise, saw the sliver of orange light spill out from inside. He positioned Jimin’s head at the sliver opening. Inside, over a dozen men were shouting, pushing each other, and waving money around. Blood and sweat, violence and suspense.

“You want them to see you like this?” Jungkook asked automatically, his hands thrumming with power as Jimin gasped, looking up at him with glassy, bewildered eyes, not yet grasping the gravity of the situation Jungkook was trying to create. The humiliation. The violence he was hoping for. “Look at them working so hard in there. Don’t you think they deserve a little whore for company?”

He felt Jimin reach up for his arm, gripping at his shirt sleeve. Jungkook licked his lips.

“Do not leave me, please,” he heard the servant plead, beginning to cry as Jungkook shoved his head closer to the door. It would be easy to open it. He thought about how they would react at the sight meager, tiny, shamed Jimin shoved their way, unable to leave because Jungkook would hold the door shut. How Jimin would be so scared he would cry, maybe wet his pants, finding himself at the bottom of the hierarchy even at servitude level in the middle of heightened violence and anger and a freight of masculine bodies, humiliated.

“You do not wish to join your friends?” Jungkook asked, playing pitying and confused as if he did not know servants and manual workers were carved from an entirely different crop.

“Th-They are not my friends,” Jimin pleaded through panicked gasps, holding onto Jungkook’s shirt so hard it was wrinkling. Jungkook frowned, wanting the boy off himself.

He yanked his shirt out of the tiny hand, kicking Jimin closer to the door. Jimin looked back at him, horrified. He watched Jungkook’s hand reach for the handle.

“I think your friends will be happy to see you.”

Without waiting for Jimin to react, Jungkook yanked the door open to kick the boy in, hearing himself yell shrill reprimands about punishment and obedience and needing to learn to appreciate living inside the estate and not sleeping in the barn with the other lowlifes. A swarm of noises passed by him in a few seconds, cascading down his ears and ringing in them until he had the door slammed shut in Jimin’s back, holding it in an iron grip.

It was quiet on the inside for a second, an odd change of tone from the rowdiness before. Jungkook straightened out his shirt while clamping the door shut with his boot and right elbow, feeling his upper lip and armpits sweat in a sickly exhilarated suspense.

Then, laughing came rumbling from the inside. High on adrenaline and his own fortitude, Jungkook heard thrumming in his head, alongside the beating of his heart, hammering rhythmically in a vicious accompaniment to the high-pitched yelling that followed, which he distinctly recognized as his servant’s voice. The laughing morphed with shrill, panicked screams, along with low voices of complaint, confusion and stir. There was banging on the surface of the door he was holding fast, which Jungkook dissipated easily.

“Please, please, please—Master, I’m sorry,” he heard Jimin’s babe-like protests pressed against the door, rustling and more laughter.

Jungkook smiled, to himself, imagining in his head the tears running down his servant’s cheeks. He just wanted his toy pressed on a little bit. A little roughed up; spooked even. Tasting a little taste of Hell enough to settle for his purgatory, the humiliation of his state carved into his bones.

He sighed, straightening up, then proceeded to yank the door back open. Surprisingly, Jimin had managed to stay clawing at the door, this time falling into Jungkook’s legs with two men having grabbed his arms while laughing at him. Jungkook looked down Jimin’s body at them, their faces now wide and pale with fear and realization.
Jimin looked up at him teary-eyed, arms trembling and scrambling for purchase on the legs of his trousers. He placed his wet face cloyingly begging onto his leg, wrapping his tiny arms around Jungkook’s thighs. The men near Jimin jerked back, as if touched by fire, eyes horrified as they looked up into Jungkook’s apathetic ones.

“P-Please, save me, please,” he heard Jimin mumble into his thigh, quivering into him as he pleaded for his life.

Jungkook let Jimin press his face into the fabric of his trousers to hide himself, whining fearfully. Jungkook was surprised by how much he enjoyed it. He was clearly the boy’s saviour and stable presence after experiencing the true wild nature of men unkempt. The two brute-ish looking, bigger men were still crouched on the floor next to Jimin’s, hands extended to touch the small of Jimin’s back as they’d seemed to previously enjoyed how he flinched. Jungkook glanced down at his servant’s wet face, suddenly not feeling so generous or charitable anymore. Not feeling so calm.

“Do not put your hands near me, filth,” Jungkook growled, seeing the men gradually sobering up and regaining motion once realizing whose presence they were in. They widened their eyes, further taking in Jungkook’s crisp shirt and polished, heavy boots. They attempted to retreat back slowly, suddenly acres away from their prior demeanor.

Jungkook did not give them the chance, lifting his leg up and stomping it down onto one of the men’s heads, effectively knocking him out cold. The other yelped, and Jimin whimpered at the commotion, eyes still closed and face still smushed into his thigh. The men standing around like hens looking on looked away, indicating they did not want any further trouble.

Jungkook took the opportunity of blanketed fear to lean down and kneel next to Jimin’s head, cupping his ears in his hands. He offered up to him an uncharacteristically tender voice.

“This is where you would be without me.” He sank his left hand into the back of Jimin’s hair, resting it steady there, cradling his head, then continued. “I clothe you, give you the shelter of my own home, and let you roam around freely. Do I ask for much in return?”

Jimin shook his head, bowing it so low Jungkook almost had to fight to hold it up to make his point.

“And you would not ever forsake my kindness, would you?” He asked, stroking the boy’s sweaty hair. Jimin looked up at him sincerely, tear-stained, red in the face and all, eyes so clear and eager even in the face of danger, looking only for his Master, for Jungkook, to reach him.

“No, Master.”

Though Namjoon had tried many times, and in different ways, to change the fate of the situation in the manor—of what he had seen and felt unfolding with its fibrous, tendrillar arms into every nook and cranny of the walls, spoiling every surface with the inkly, clotty, dark staining reach of destruction—in the end, he’d been powerless to change the course of the tide.

Now mostly confined to his study and his bedchambers, Namjoon rarely ventured out, greeting his parents monotonously once in a while as he passed them in the halls, their heads screwed on the wrong way around as they were unable to perceive the monstrous, horrid shift in the air. The shift which always emanated most prominently from his little brother’s room. Namjoon would pass it every once in a while, wondering ever so fleetingly what went on inside. Remembering Jimin, as he had seen him last, flush with devotion and hair tucked neatly behind his ear. He wondered if he still burned hot for the same cause, spun so tightly around Jungkook’s little finger he could not let go.

The answer came to him one night when his spineless, hollowed, shell of a self dared to look for them around the manor after he surmised that he had not seen nor heard from his little brother or his little servant for weeks. And he would regret looking for them for the rest of his life, as his eyes would drink in the scene in their father’s study, that he’d stood and watched for hours, unable to tear himself away.

The armchair their father always used to sit on stood firm in the center of the room, angled slightly away from the door so that Namjoon could not see Jungkook’s face, though he could see his telltale tall body sitting in it, legs extended and bent sturdy into the floorboard beneath him as he slouched in the chair. He was holding a book of poetry that Namjoon did not recognize, waving it about lazily, making Namjoon unsure of whether or not he was actually reading it. As Namjoon moved his gaze down, past the black of Jungkook’s pants and the flickering embers in the fireplace that rattled into the silence, he spotted the unmistakable, glaring sight of Jimin, naked and pressed as close to the floor as he could, clutching at Jungkook’s left foot.

And they stayed like that, no matter how many pages in the book Jungkook turned or how long Namjoon had wondered whether the servant’s back or knees hurt. Namjoon stood outside, transfixed, powerless, and feeling absolutely spayed. Jungkook did not at all have to look at him from his victorious position, calm and serene, in the largest chair they owned in the entire estate, reading or choosing not to read pretentious poetry from their vast, expensive collection, to tell Namjoon what he already now knew.

There was a new Head of House.
