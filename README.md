f“He’s looking at you again.”

Jimin sighs when he hears Hoseok whisper in his ear again.

“He looks at you every single time they come over.”

“Can you stop?” Jimin hisses more than whispers. “You know they have great hearing and I don’t want them to hear your nonsense.”

Hoseok pouts but doesn’t do so for long, his lips turning up into a smile after he looks at their guests. Jimin suppresses the disgusted grunt that threatens to slip past his lips, and picks up the last crane of melons to carry them to their guests. Minding the rock on the ground – which Jimin will have to put away later – he reminds himself to neither to show any fear like he did in the past, nor the distaste that he’s feeling right now. He hands over the crane to a wolf without looking at him properly, and almost groans when he realises it’s the alpha Hoseok had been talking about, wishing he had gone to the other side.

Jimin has met the alpha a quite a few times and knows by now that his name is Jungkook and that he’s one of the candidates for becoming the next head alpha of his pack. One of the reasons for that is that Jungkook is somewhat of a war hero. When a skirmish broke out between Jungkook’s pack and another one five years ago, the other pack attacked Jimin’s village. Around ten humans died that day and many more were hurt.

Since the human villages exist, they have also become a target for enemy packs. Though usually most of the head alphas are too noble to attack human villages, not all of them care for nobility. Jimin’s village became a target and Jungkook was one of the alphas dispatched to them. That was the same time Jimin made a name for himself alongside Jungkook.

Pushing the memories aside, Jimin takes the last steps towards Jungkook. With dismay, Jimin notes how the crane full of melons looks so much lighter in the alpha’s hands as he puts it in the back of the pick-up truck. As if it isn’t enough that he’s so much broader and taller than Jimin, he also has to be stronger.

Jimin is strong. He has made sure that he is, and the only reason he volunteered to be one of the traders with the wolves is, to show them he can meet them head-on despite being a human. That sadly doesn’t change how the wolves naturally are stronger than him.

Too preoccupied with grumbling on the inside, Jimin forgets about the rock on the ground and trips over it. He only has a second to curse himself for being stupid enough to trip in front of the wolves. The ground is gradually coming closer to his face, when it suddenly stops a meter before it. Heart pounding in his chest, Jimin needs a moment to notice that he’s not falling anymore, a pair of arms wound around his torso. He turns his head slowly, fear creeping in alongside embarrassment.

“You okay?” Jungkook asks him. Something deep inside Jimin stirs.

Jimin has to bite his lower lip to stop himself from gasping indignantly. Okay? Okaaay???? He is not okay at all. As if tripping in front of the wolves isn’t bad enough, he had to land in the arms of one right in front of all the villagers present at the exchange. Hoseok is also still here, and he won’t let him hear the end of this.

Scrambling to his feet, Jimin ignores the burning in his cheeks and cleared his throat. “Thank you,” he says through gritted teeth and marches off awkwardly. He rolls his eyes when he sees Hoseok gaping at him, a grin already forming on his face.

Jimin neither acknowledges Hoseok for the remainder of the time the wolves are readying themselves to drive off, nor does he look back at the alpha. It isn’t until he hears the pick-up truck drive away that Jimin dares to take a peek. He instantly regrets it when he is met with the smiling face of the alpha.



The first memory Jimin has of his life is about his mother telling him about the wolves in the woods. As a three-year-old child, Jimin had been intently listening to his mother, reading every word from her lips. He remembers being captivated by the stories; captivated and scared. Despite that, he had wanted to hear more, had begged his mother every night to tell him even more stories. So his mother did.

“There are wolves in the woods,” his mother began, “We don’t know how they came to be but they’ve been here since the beginning. Though they look like us, like humans, they can turn into wolves whenever they please. They are our ancestors and we live by their mercy.”

“What’s an ancestor?” Jimin remembers asking.

“They are family members who lived before us. Some of their children were human, and we come from those humans.”

“If they are family, can I turn into a wolf too?” Jimin had asked excitedly.

Jimin still remembers the sad smile his mother had given, and the way she brushed back his hair with a shaking hand. “No. We lost our second nature that allows wolves to turn. That’s it for tonight. It’s late.”

Jimin had whined and begged for more stories but his mother didn’t tell them for a while afterwards.

Unlike back then, Jimin now knows the rules, that’s why he knows he’s screwed right now.

 

Jimin was doing nothing new. Like he does weekly, Jimin went into the woods, entering the designated area the wolves allowed the humans to hunt on – the rest belonging to them – and wanted to hunt a deer. It has been four days now since the wolves had visited and he couldn’t get the alpha and his smile out of his head, which annoyed him. When he had gotten a request from the butcher to hunt a deer, if not a deer then at least a boar, he had happily accepted, thinking a hunt would take his mind off of the alpha. This is all he had intended to do.

He doesn’t know when he went too far. He had only been following the deer, not wanting to lose him, especially after that missed shot where he hit the deer’s upper leg instead of his lungs. Jimin had lost it for a moment but then found her again after running for a while, following a trail of blood. Jimin is just like that. He always gets what his clients ask of him, nothing else. And maybe his pride could also not let him live down the fact that he missed the deer.

Shouldering the rifle, Jimin had taken a moment to calm down, panting too hard from the run. He remembers how his breathing had steadied, his heart no longer pounding as loudly. His finger had slowly moved to the trigger as the deer sunk its head to drink from the lake. He had pressed the trigger but instead of hitting the brown deer, he had hit something grey.

 

Jimin was only five years old when his parents had screamed at him for walking too deeply into the woods. Though he had heard that the wolves were dangerous and he should fear them, it hadn’t really sunk in.

He learned more about them in school, learned that they lived in packs, learned about alphas, betas and omegas, and that they have a clear hierarchy where the head alpha is the strongest among them. He learned how the first humans came to be, how they didn’t turn at their coming of age when they became twenty, how they were considered late bloomers at first and then abominations later. He learned how the first of them were killed as a punishment for whatever stopped them from turning.

The rising number of humans had caused a mass panic in the packs. Wolves were afraid of getting infected with whatever it was that stopped their peers from turning, were afraid that they would become a part of this divine punishment by allowing the “abominations” to exist.

The packs learned to distinguish those who will be able to turn and who won’t, and began killing them before they could even reach their coming of age, some as young as infants.

It’s not known how the executions of humans stopped in other packs but their village came to be after an omega fought her head alpha, when he had attempted to kill her pup, who was only five days old. At the end of the fight, she had lain bleeding on the ground but the head alpha neither killed the mother, nor the pup.

He had let them leave, had allowed her to live on a piece of land on their territory and then sent every human of their pack to her. That is how their village came to be.

By now, it is rare for humans to be born into wolf packs but the villages created out of the first outcasts are big enough to prosper without them.

Despite knowing the gruesome past of his fellow human beings, Jimin was still surprised to see how cruel the wolves still could be.

He was only eight years old when he finally understood what his mother meant when she said they as humans ‘live by their mercy.’ He doesn’t remember the details anymore, doesn’t know what the man was accused of, but some wolves had brought him to the market square and demanded the mayor meet them.

It was the first time Jimin had seen a pack member. Two were in their human forms, one old but nothing like Jimin’s friendly grandfather or the old neighbour who always gave him warm pastry fresh from the oven. He looked sterner than their teacher when he was really mad. They were flanked by two giant wolves, looking menacing, their ears constantly twitching and snouts sniffing the air.

It was then that Jimin understood why his parents always forced him to stay at home when the wolves came to trade with them, why they never allowed him to meet them. And it was then that Jimin had realised that all his boasting talk about not being afraid of the wolves was nothing but that: talk. He had been afraid, so much that his knees were shaking and he was hiding behind his mother’s skirt.

The old wolf – Jimin later found out he was the head alpha – had demanded the death penalty for the man, had ignored the cries of plea of the man’s family members, and made them choose between hanging until death in the market place or being mauled by the wolves in his pack.

 

Jimin froze the moment he shot the grey thing and heard a loud thud, too scared to check what it is that he hit. There is a lake, Jimin notes belatedly. There is no lake on the human territory. The lake is on the wolves’ territory. Jimin blinks, taking in a shuddering breath. Tears sting his eyes, and he begins shaking uncontrollably.

You need to look up, Jimin tells himself. You need to make sure he’s fine.

That thought feels like Jimin gets shot too. No, Jimin thinks, that was just another animal. It was no ‘he’ or ‘she’ but an animal. Despite these reassurances, Jimin needs a while to look up and check. He gasps when he sees the grey wolf – too big to be an ordinary wolf – and drops his rifle. His shaking worsens until he needs to lean against a nearby tree so he doesn’t fall to the ground.

Jimin firmly keeps his eyes on the wolf, wishing, praying that he gets up, is only hurt and not dead. Wolves have superior healing powers than humans. There is no way a bullet can kill them. It isn’t until he sees the wolf make a weak attempt at getting up that Jimin moves too, his heart that seemed to have stopped beating suddenly beating too fast. He staggers to the body, falling once and crawling the rest of the way until he is by his side, and immediately wishes he hadn’t.

There is too much blood, way too much blood. Jimin shot the wolf right in his ribcage, blood pouring from the wound, and it had pierced his lung. The wolf was wheezing, a wet sound that will haunt Jimin for life. There is blood on his snout too.

Jimin sobs when he looks at the wolf and sees him looking at right at him. He presses a hand to the wound in a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding. It’s too late, Jimin knows. There is no way his lung can heal from a gunshot wound but Jimin cannot help it.

“I-I’m s-sorry,” Jimin whispers. “I’m s-so sorry.”

The wolf just looks at him, a rattle in his lungs, spitting blood with every breath.

“I didn- didn’t mean t-to,” Jimin continues, needing the wolf to understand.

The wolf’s breathing grows weak, which Jimin notices immediately as he is now pressing both hands to the wound. He sobs again, his apology cut off by it. It’s then that Jimin hears a noise and he turns his head in time to see three wolves bursting out from between the trees. His shaking and sobbing stop immediately, body paralysed by fear. The three wolves look at him, sitting next to the bleeding wolf. Jimin sees when they finally process what is happening, that their pack member is dying. One of them howls loudly, while two others turn into their human form and run towards Jimin.

Jimin needs to move. He needs to make space for the wolves so they can help the dying wolf and maybe save him somehow but he is still paralysed, rooted to the spot.

“What did you do?” one of the wolves growls into his face, pushing Jimin out of the way to press her own hands to the wound.

Jimin can’t answer, too focused on his blood-drenched hands. He caused this. He killed someone. Not just anyone but a wolf. The world goes still, every colour getting dull and every sound growing distant.

A few years ago, the head alpha died and was replaced by another. Jimin had seen him when he came to the village to introduce, and he can still hear his mother – who had met the new head alpha on a few occasions for trade – talk about how nice he is. Over the years as Jimin traded with the pack, he came to agree with his mother: the new head alpha is nicer than the previous one, but Jimin doubts even he is nice enough to let the death of a wolf go unpunished – accident or not.

Jimin is shaken out of his stupor, sound and sight coming back. He turns his head into the direction he hears his name coming from and is met with a familiar face. Jungkook is looking at him wide eyes, concern visible in them. That is such a welcoming and comforting sight, that Jimin can’t help being crying again, body wracked with sobs. Jungkook wraps an arm around his shoulders, which takes Jimin by surprise. He hadn’t expected an arm around his shoulders but a hand around his throat.

That small moment of comfort from the “enemy” doesn’t last long, interrupted by an imperious presence.

“Is that him?”

Jimin looks up, staring straight at the head alpha.



Sighing for the umpteenth time, Jimin suppresses the urge to scratch his face. He was brought to the pack and, surprisingly enough without torture, questioned by the head alpha. Jimin explained the situation in front of the scrutinising and grievous faces as best as he could before he was brought into a nearby cabin and locked into a room. It’s surprising that no one is guarding him, but despite that Jimin isn’t stupid enough to try escape through the window.

He doesn’t know whether he could make them understand but he hopes that at least their mayor will be able to appease the wolves somehow. Though the wolves’ decision is final, they can’t make one without at least consulting the humans when it’s about them. Will the mayor be able to convince them? Jimin doubts it. The setting sun outside, making him more hopeless. It’ll be night soon, and Jimin doesn’t know if he’ll get to see the sun again.

Wanting to rub his face with his hands, Jimin gasps when he’s suddenly met with the blood on them. He thrusts his hands down and hides them under his thighs. He hadn’t gotten a chance to wash the blood off yet, and he doesn’t see a bathroom anywhere in sight. Leaving the room to look for one isn’t an option either. He doesn’t want someone to walk in and see the room empty and then spread the word that he fled.

He looks around the room. It’s small, some kind of store room where someone keeps things that he doesn’t need but also doesn’t want to part from. One corner of it is filled with art supplies though.

Jimin is in the middle of singing a song from his village in his head to keep his thoughts away from the blood on his hands and the dying wolf, when the door opens, and Jungkook steps inside. Jimin balls his hands into fists, and presses himself closer against the wall. A small part of him is relieved upon seeing that’s it Jungkook. Remembering the concern Jimin saw in his eyes when Jungkook found him in the woods, the same concern Jimin is seeing as Jungkook looks at him. It takes Jimin by surprise.

Jungkook sets a large bowl, which Jimin sees only now, filled with water on the ground and motions for Jimin. “I thought you might want to wash the blood off.”

Jimin tenses up and looks at Jungkook with guarded eyes. Is this a trick?

“I got you something to change into,” Jungkook says, putting a shirt and pair of pants on the ground, a towel on top of it.

With bated breath, Jimin watches Jungkook for a while before he hesitantly crawls closer to the bowl. Jungkook holds the towel out to him and motions to Jimin’s face, “There’s some blood on your face too.”

Jimin reaches for the towel but stops when he sees the blood on his hands again, gulping audibly.

“Let me,” Jungkook whispers, dipping one edge of the towel in the water and wiping Jimin’s face with it.

Jimin is surprised to find the towel to be warm. Jungkook had actually gotten warm water for him. Jimin doesn’t know how the heating system in the pack is but he’s sure no one else would have brought him water, let alone warm one.

Satisfied with his work, Jungkook puts the towel aside and reaches for Jimin’s hands. He dips one into the warm water and washes the blood off himself, doing the same with his other hand too. Jimin can’t bear to see the water turn pink and then, so he looks up at Jungkook instead, even if it’s embarrassing.

“Why are you doing this?” Jimin asks quietly, his heart fluttering when he notices how soft Jungkook’s touch is.

Jungkook should be devastated, crying like the other wolves whom Jimin can hear through the window, but instead here he is, gently wiping his own pack member’s blood from Jimin’s hands. Instead of mourning for his pack member, Jungkook is here comforting and taking care of Jimin.

Suddenly, Hoseok’s words pop up in Jimin’s head again. “He’s looking at you.”

Jungkook lips curl up lightly, and the gentle look in his eyes as he looks up at Jimin for a second makes Jimin’s heart skip a beat.

“Would you believe me if I said that I don’t like seeing you in distress?”

Jimin’s jaw drops. He wants to say something, he should say something, but forming a coherent sentence is too much.

“He looks at you every single time they come over.”

The atmosphere grows heavy, the air thick with tension.

For a second Jimin believes to see an intense glint in Jungkook’s eyes but then the alpha starts washing his hand again, and continues, “Your mayor is here. He’s trying to negotiate with the head alpha and the council.”

“Was the deer found?”

Jungkook nods. “Found it and brought it back. Bullet wound to the leg just like you said, and found a blood trail into the human territory. Your story checks out.”

Jimin should sigh in relief and try to calm his racing heart but Jungkook’s gloomy face does not allow that. He slips his hands out of the alpha’s grasp and clutches his hand in his own.

“That’s not enough, is it?”  he asks, preparing to hear the worst but still hoping that he won’t.

Jungkook is silent for a moment, and then shakes his head.

“Why?” Jimin asks, can’t help the frustration seeping into his voice.

“You killed a wolf, Jimin. On our territory. The punishment for any murder on our territory, on any wolf territory, is death.”

“But it was an accident. He just suddenly jumped right in front of the deer. I never meant to shoot him.”

“And we get that,” Jungkook assures but Jimin can still hear that tiny ‘but’ in his voice. “We get that you’re a human from our village and that you have different rules over there but you were on our territory and it’s different for us. Wolves need stricter rules, rules that say that any death on your hands means the death penalty, or everyone would just do whatever they please. He was a pack member, Jimin. I know you don’t get that but when a pack member gets killed, it’s like you were hit too, and you can’t stop unless he’s avenged, whether you liked that wolf or not.

“On top of that, he was killed by a human, a weaker creature. If we let a human who killed a wolf go, it would look like a weakness and allow other humans to just barge in here and start shooting at us because they don’t fear us anymore. It has happened to too many packs already. So some of them are demanding the death penalty.”

“Some? What do the rest say?” Jimin croaks, swallowing hard as fresh tears start rolling down his cheeks. He hates how much sense Jungkook’s reasons make.

“Your mayor asked for a lighter punishment because of your contributions five years ago. That’s why some have agreed to… cutting off your hands instead of sentencing you to death. They’ll decide in the morning.”

“Hands? Not one hand but both hands? If I don’t bleed out or die from an infection, then I will certainly starve to death.”

Jungkook’s brows furrow and his eyes harden at Jimin’s words. Jimin finds it illogical but it’s almost as if the alpha is angry.

“Why not just one hand?” Jimin asks, thinking that’s the best he should hope for in these dire circumstances. He can still make a living with one hand. He’ll figure something out.

Jimin is hoping Jungkook will help him, considering how understanding the wolf has been so far, but instead the frown on Jungkook’s face just deepens.

“What…” Jungkook starts slowly, the glint Jimin had seen in his eyes earlier returning, “if I have a way of making you avoid punishment?”

Jimin stares at Jungkook for a while, gaping, and then says, “How?”

“Pack members are spared from punishment in some rare cases. Considering your contributions from five years ago and the fact that this was an accident, you would be spared if you were a pack member.”

“H-how is that even possible? I’m human.”

Jungkook stares at Jimin, eyes wandering from Jimin’s face to his body and back up at his face. If Jimin didn’t know any better, he’d say that he almost looks hungry. Suddenly, Jimin is painfully aware of how big and buff the wolf in front of him is, and that he is an alpha. Jimin has seen first-hand how strong alphas are, why, at school, they were adamantly taught to be most careful around them. They are the strongest of a pack for a reason, and the alpha in front of Jimin is a war hero.

“Leave that to me,” Jungkook says, voice hoarse suddenly. It sends tingles down Jimin’s spine.

Jungkook leaves, not only the room but the cabin altogether. Jimin frowns, looks out the window and then at the door again. He wonders if he should be worried but as long as Jungkook can make him keep his hands, he supposes he shouldn’t be. Instead, he turns to the clothes Jungkook left next to him and decides to change into them. He has barely put on the shirt, shirt and pants both too big on him, when Jungkook comes bursting into the room.

Flinching, Jimin faces Jungkook with wides eyes. Jungkook is panting and looks impatient but he stops when his eyes land on Jimin, jaw falling open.

“Fuck,” he murmurs.

“What?” Jimin looks down on himself, wondering whether he wore the clothes inside out or if there’s anything else weird about it.

“Nothing.” Jungkook shakes his head and holds a phial out to Jimin. “Drink this.”

Hesitantly, Jimin takes the phial and stares at the dark blue contents. He shouldn’t drink it. He doesn’t even know what it is, but Jungkook promised a solution where he wouldn’t get punished. Moreover, if it weren’t for Jungkook, he might soon not have any hands to hold anything in. So, with a racing heart, Jimin unplugs the phial and drains the content. He waits with bated breath, relieved but also confused when nothing other than small tingle in Jimin’s gut happens.

“What now?” Jimin asks.

“Now I’m going to do something... bad,” Jungkook responds, taking a step towards Jimin.

“What?”

“You like me, don’t you?” Jungkook says with a tiny smirk, taking another step towards Jimin. Now he’s standing right in front of him.

Jimin licks his lip, his heartbeat increasing and something twisting in his gut. “W-what are you talking about?”

Jungkook puts a hand on Jimin’s waist, making Jimin’s breath hitch. Jimin fans his face with one hand, suddenly feeling hot. He notes his breathing is coming out faster too.

Ignoring Jimin’s questions, Jungkook continues in a sultry voice, “I, for one, like you a lot.”

Jimin stares at Jungkook wide-eyed, the confession too sudden.

“Is this the right time for a confession?”

“It’s the perfect time.” Jungkook leans down until his nose right next to Jimin’s throat and inhales through his nose. “Has anyone ever told you how good you smell?”

The words make Jimin’s cock twitch, and he bites his lip to suppress the whine. This isn’t normal, Jimin decides then. No matter how attracted he is to Jungkook, he’s reacting too fast. Not even five minutes ago, he was scared to death, and now he’s suppressing whines.

“What d-did I just drink?” Jimin asks. It takes all of his willpower to ignore Jungkook’s hot breaths on his neck.

“An aphrodisiac.”

Jimin gasps, looking up at Jungkook wide-eyed. “Why would you give me that?”

Sliding his arm around Jimin’s waist, Jungkook pulls the human closer. This small action makes Jimin whole body burn and throb. There is no denial that Jungkook did give him an aphrodisiac. Putting his other hand on the back of Jimin’s head, Jungkook loses no time in leaning down and pressing his lips to Jimin’s.

Jimin should protest and push the alpha back, but instead he lets out an embarrassingly loud whine and reciprocates the kiss. It alleviates some of the heat that is threatening to consume Jimin, which is why he can’t bring himself to push the alpha away. Instead, he wraps his arms around Jungkook to keep him as close as possible.

Jungkook growls, literally growls, a sound Jimin hasn’t heard anyone make during a make-out session, and his kisses grow fiercer. Jimin has never been kissed like this before. There was never this much fervour and hunger. It felt like Jungkook was sucking out his soul along with the air in Jimin’s lungs, pulling him closer to uncharted territory. Jimin should have had enough of this today but he can’t resist the allure.

At some point, Jungkook pulls back, and Jimin takes in big lungfuls of air. It had completely escaped Jimin’s notice that he almost passed out just now. As much as Jimin is happy about being able to breathe again, the inaction passes his attention to the throbbing ache in his pants. It also gives him a moment of clarity.

He raises his head from Jungkook’s shoulder, where he had been resting it, to question Jungkook again, but is silenced by the intensity in his eyes. Jimin had seen that look before; that look that freezes you and roots you to the spot. So far he had only ever gotten it from predators or wolves in their wolf form; never from anyone in a human form.

Suddenly, Jungkook wraps his arms around Jimin’s thighs and picks him up. Jimin squeaks, and scrambles for support. He wraps his legs around Jungkook’s hips, hands balling into his shirt. Jungkook carries him out of the room and into another one. Jimin’s heart skips a beat when his eyes land on the bed, and in the next second he’s laying on it, Jungkook on top of it.

The alpha wastes no time, immediately going back to kissing Jimin. Jimin makes a protesting sound which is devoured by Jungkook. So he tries with his fists instead, pushing against Jungkook’s chest and pulling at his shirt. Nothing seems to work. Jungkook, unbothered, keeps kissing Jimin and eliciting the most pleased and breathless noises out of Jimin, hands wandering along Jimin’s side and under his shirt. As a last resort, and a bit unwillingly, Jimin bites down on Jungkook’s lip; hard. Jungkook pulls back, tongue darting out to lick away the drop of blood pooling on his lower lip.

Ignoring the beast-like look in Jungkook’s eyes, Jimin pants, “Wh-why are you d-doing this?”

Jungkook’s eyes turn a bit gentle but it doesn’t chase away the hunger, and he doesn’t pull back. Freeing his shirt from Jimin’s fists, Jungkook pins them to the mattress next to Jimin’s head.

“I’m a very selfish guy, Jimin,” Jungkook whispers, breath dancing on Jimin’s sore lips. “And I’m extremely possessive. I can’t let anyone have you. Not even death.”

Tingles spark all over Jimin’s body, and Jimin is surprised by how much Jimin is affected by Jungkook’s words. Before he can ask Jungkook for further clarification, the thought is lost in the delicious friction that Jungkook causes between their crotches. Jimin mewls when his throbbing, hardened cock finally gets the desired attention, and suddenly no other thought is important.

Jimin raises his hips in search for some relief again, moaning into Jungkook’s mouth. Jungkook presses Jimin’s hips down with his hand, moving his hips against Jimin’s, Jimin feeling how hard Jungkook already is. He doesn’t care how desperate he looks right now, and how he’s humping Jungkook like some horny teenager. He’s too far gone to care about anything but relief, no longer kissing Jungkook but just breathing into his mouth.

They lose their clothes at some points – the only thing Jimin remembers is that he was annoyed at Jungkook for removing himself from Jimin for a moment to take them off. All the question he had, all the doubts and confusion are forgotten, burned away by the heat Jimin is feeling. He’s hot and sweaty and hard; so, so hard.

Jimin gasps when he feels an oil-slicked finger at his entrance. Jungkook is circling his hole with his finger before slowly pushing inside, the other hand pumping Jimin’s cock in slow motions. He doesn’t feel the second finger through all the pleasure but when Jungkook adds the third one, he does make a pained sound.

Jimin had anal sex before. He had been with two men before but that has been so long ago. He also fingers himself sometimes when he feels like getting himself off with just his cock isn’t enough but they don’t feel like Jungkook’s. The alpha’s fingers are so much longer and thicker than his, having a deeper reach than Jimin’s, and Jimin can’t wait to have Jungkook’s cock inside him. By the time Jungkook has added a fourth finger, Jimin is too impatient, his cock too hard.

“J-just put it ah put it in,” he breathes, swatting at Jungkook’s hands that is thrusting in and out of Jimin.

Jungkook leans over him, not stopping either hand. “Trust me, you don’t want that.”

Jimin bites Jungkook’s lips again, offended by his words, and hisses, “Just put it in.”

Letting out a chuckle, a sadistic grin appears on Jungkook’s face. Without saying anything, he thrusts his fingers deeper inside, curling them up and stroking that one sweet spot inside Jimin. Jimin screams, hands reaching out to grip Jungkook’s bicep and shoulders, nails digging into his skin. The alpha is unbothered by it, stroking faster.

Jimin throws his head back, gasping and panting as Jungkook’s fingers relentlessly and mercilessly stroke his prostate. He’s coming soon, screaming and cock twitching in Jungkook’s hand while his orgasm hits him. Too late he notices Jungkook’s hand tightening around the base of his cock. His legs are still shaking after he comes down but his orgasm was dissatisfying.

Jimin glares at Jungkook with tears in his eyes, some of which he had shed in the middle of his orgasm. The alpha is still smirking at him devilishly, pulling his fingers out too abruptly. Jimin gasps from the sudden emptiness, hole closing and opening around air.

Jungkook sinks his hand into Jimin’s hair and tugs at it, making sure the man is looking at him before whispering, “Bad boys don’t get to enjoy themselves.”

Jimin would’ve felt humiliated were it not for how his body feels like it’s on fire and the aching in his cock. He will do anything to get any relief, even beg. His mind is hazy and he is driven solely by his needs, but there’s nothing else Jimin needs right now.

“Now be a good boy,” Jungkook says with another tug at Jimin’s hair.

Jimin nods, unable to form a sentence or even a word at this point. With a satisfied smile, Jungkook lets go of Jimin’s hair and reaches for the lube on the side of the bed. Jimin whimpers when he watches Jungkook lube himself up, feeling a trickle of fear at the sheer size of Jungkook’s cock. There’s something else there too, Jimin notices: excitement.

Done with the lube, Jungkook grabs Jimin’s calves and pulls the man closer to him, situating himself between his legs. He lines himself up, tip teasing Jimin’s hole as he slowly makes his way in. Jimin hums pleased, eyes closing and toes curling in anticipation of the pleasure. What he feels instead is pain, Jungkook’s cock feeling bigger than it looks.

It only gets worse as Jungkook keeps pushing in slowly, and Jimin’s hands scramble for purchase but only finding the bed sheets, closing his eyes tightly. When he can no longer hold it in, he whimpers, hands pulling at the sheets tightly.

Jungkook starts stroking Jimin’s cock to distract him, and leans over him again, propping himself up on one hand next to Jimin’s head. “Relax,” he breathes into Jimin’s ear. “It’ll hurt less.”

Jimin bites his lips, and doesn’t respond, but he does wrap his arms around Jungkook’s shoulders, holding onto him. With a grunt, and a pained gasp from Jimin, Jungkook bottoms out.

“Fuck,” Jungkook growls, nosing along Jimin’s neck. “You’re so tight.”

Jimin can’t respond. He needs all his energy to breathe properly. When Jungkook finally moves, it’s painful and relieving at the same time. Jungkook, having stopped stroking Jimin’s dick, slowly picks up the pace, hips moving faster. Slowly, Jimin’s pained gasps turn into moans, the drag of Jimin’s cock against Jimin’s hole no longer burning. Jimin is finally getting some real relief, and he is losing himself in it.

His mind is getting hazy. Only Jungkook, who kisses Jimin from time to time, is in focus. If he were sane, he’d be embarrassed by the squelching sound the joining of their hips makes, and by the needy pants and hiccups he’s letting out. But all that doesn’t matter. The only important thing is how Jungkook feels inside him and how his hand travels over Jimin’s body, one of them wrapping around Jimin’s hips and raising them into the air. With the next thrust, Jungkook’s tip brushes against Jimin’s prostate, Jimin releasing a high-pitched moan.

Jimin wraps his legs around Jungkook’s hips to keep the alpha as close as possible. Jungkook’s nose finds its way back to Jimin’s neck, as if in search for something, sniffing and growling. Jimin doesn’t notice any of it, too distracted by his approaching orgasm. He holds Jungkook tighter as the man’s cock keeps brushing against his prostate, and throws his head back when he reaches his orgasm. Jimin moans, blissful and high, legs shaking from the aftereffects of his orgasm. That changes when Jungkook bites down on his neck, his eyes flying open with a pained gasp.



Jimin wakes up slowly, opening his eyes once but keeps them closed afterwards. He’s waking up and he resigns himself to his fate but he’s in no hurry to do so, keeping still on his stomach. He keeps his eyes closed, too warm and comfy to even move an inch. As his mind clears up slowly, so does his memory and his senses. The sheets he’s entangled with do not smell like his, and his sheets are not quite as rough as these. Bleary, Jimin blinks multiple times and lifts his head to look at the room. He turns, and that’s when pain shoots through his lower back and he gasps, fists clenching into the sheets. And just like that, memories from the previous night flood in, overwhelming Jimin.

Jungkook had given him an aphrodisiac and they had sex. Not just once but multiple times. Jimin doesn’t even remember most of it. He was too out of it, woozy from the aphrodisiac.

With difficulty, Jimin manages to turn onto his back, whining when pain flares up in his back again. He waits until it has subsided to think about what happened. There is not a single reason Jimin can think of why Jungkook would drug him and have sex with him. Maybe he wanted to have sex with Jimin at least once before Jimin s is sentenced to death and thought Jimin wouldn’t get into the mood for it unless he’s drugged. That doesn’t sound like Jungkook though. So why? That aside, Jimin can’t even begin to think of what he should make of being drugged and having sex with someone. And for some reason, Jungkook isn’t even in the room with him.

Jimin moves his arms to heave himself into a sitting position but freezes when he feels a sting in his right shoulder. He reaches up with his left hand to touch the area, heart skipping a beat when he feels a circle wound and some blood clot. Jimin’s breathing quickens and he forces himself into a sitting position, biting down on his lower lip to bear the pain. He needs a mirror and he needs it now, aching body be damned.

Pulling a sheet around his naked, and very marked up, body, Jimin walks to the mirror that he sees hanging on the wall in the corner of the room. He casts one look at his shoulder and his eyes widen, mouth going slack. A series of teeth marks is left on shoulders, deep and, by now, clotted. Jimin has talked about this in school and seen some faded marks on some wolves but he has never seen a fresh one. It’s a mating bite.

The room spins, and Jimin has to lean against the nearest wall to keep himself upright. He was given a mating bite. Jungkook gave him a mating bite. He is human but he has a wolf’s mating bite, and he has no idea what this means.

Once the dizziness subsides, Jimin limps back to the bed and sits down on it. At a loss for what to do, Jimin starts collecting the clothes Jungkook gave him last night and that are now spread all over the floor. He wants to shower but there is no way he can do that alone in this condition, so he puts the clothes on, wincing every now and then, and then sits on the bed again, trying to regain his breathing. Putting on clothes had never been this exhausting before.

The panic Jimin had managed to keep under control by acting normal is starting to settle in, a good amount of confusion too. He is hurting all over, is close to tears, and wishes Jungkook were here.

Wait.

Why would he wish Jungkook were here? Jungkook did this to him. He should be staying away from him. For some reason, a part of Jimin objects to that thought.

In that moment, Jimin hears voices coming from outside and then the front door is opened. With each step taken towards the room Jimin is, Jimin’s heart beats faster until the door is opened and he breathes a sigh of relief upon seeing Jungkook.

“Shit,” Jungkook curses immediately and closes the door behind, walking towards Jimin. “You’re awake already.”

Jimin flinches, leaning away from Jungkook’s touch. He may have been happy to see Jungkook, but now he’s conflicted. This is the man who made him drink an aphrodisiac and fucked him while he was in a senseless state.

Jungkook grows more cautious after Jimin’s rejection and crouches next to the man so he’s looking up at him.

“How are you feeling?” Jungkook asks.

Jimin stares into his wide, doe like eyes, trying to piece together the events from last night. He doesn’t answer, just swallows audibly, and tries to remain calm so the tears gathering in his eyes won’t spill.

“You’re confused,” Jungkook whispers and smiles reassuringly at Jimin. “That’s normal. It’s okay. I’m here.”

Jimin hates it but those words do sound reassuring and make him feel warm, especially the last part.

Carefully and slowly, Jungkook takes a seat next to Jimin and raises his hand. When Jimin doesn’t flinch this time, Jungkook cups his cheek, wiping away the tears that fall when Jimin closes his eyes and leans into the touch. It’s instinctual, something Jimin doesn’t have the energy to fight. In the next moment, he’s sitting in Jungkook’s lap, face buried in Jungkook’s neck as the alpha holds him close and whispers sweet nothings into his ear.

His walls broken down, Jimin lets the wolf comfort him, and, once he’s calmed down, undress him and take a bath in bathroom. His sore and aching body sags with relief when he’s laid into the water, by none other than Jungkook. The alpha disappears for a while; time Jimin takes to think of how similar the bathroom is to the one at home. Jungkook is back fast, with a radiant smile on his face, and helps Jimin wipe down. Any other day Jimin would rather die than have someone else wash him but he doesn’t mind, not even when Jungkook carefully cleans the bite, the smile on the alpha’s turning softer.

Once they’re done, Jungkook helps Jimin dry himself with a towel, a fresh change of clothes ready. He leads Jimin to the bedroom again, sheets changed for new ones and a tray with food on the bed. Jimin obediently sits on the bed and drinks the glass of water Jungkook presses into his hands. He was parched. The food, he doesn’t touch though, his stomach turning at the sight.

“You should eat something,” Jungkook says in a calm, comforting voice.

Jimin looks at him, voice rough from unuse. “Why?”

Jungkook blinks, taken aback by the sudden question. Jimin can see that Jungkook notes the change in his mood.

“Why did you do this?” Jimin asks, voice firmer this time.

“They were going to execute you,” Jungkook explains calmly, “just because you’re human. They won’t do that to a pack member.”

“So you gave me a mating bite?” Jimin asks, voice rising and incredulous. “Without asking me?”

Jungkook’s face hardens but he doesn’t look remorseful. It infuriates Jimin.

“You tricked me into drinking an aphrodisiac and gave me a mating bite. Me! A human. That’s fucked up!”

“It is,” Jungkook agrees, “but so is the fact that they wanted to sentence you to death for an accident.”

Jimin shakes his head. “You don’t know that. You said some were for cutting off my hands.”

“No. It was death. And you said cutting your hands was as good as being dead. And I couldn’t let either of those things happen.”

“Oh, so what?” Jimin laughs humourlessly. “You’re my saviour now? Should I bow to you in gratitude?”

“That’s not what I want,” Jungkook deadpans.

“Then what do you want? What was the purpose of this?”

“For you to live.”

Jimin is stunned into silence. Jungkook looks serious, so serious that it confuses Jimin. What is Jimin supposed to do with this information, with the look Jungkook is giving him right now? Before he can ask, there is a loud bang at the front door. Jungkook tenses, looks behind him once to check something and then back at Jimin again.

“We’ll have to go in front of the elder’s council right now,” Jungkook explains.

Jimin’s eyes widen and he bites his lower lip.

“I already told them what happened. They just want to see it with their own eyes.”

Jimin inhales deeply, eyes nervously flitting to the door when there’s another loud knock.

“I’ll be there the whole time,” Jungkook says, reaching for Jimin’s hand.

Just seconds ago, Jimin was yelling at the alpha, and now he is glad Jungkook is holding his hand.

“Lets go.”

Without any other choice, Jimin gets to his feet and follows Jungkook outside, clinging to his hand. By the time they reach the front door, Jimin’s heart is beating in his throat and blood is rushing in his ears.

Three tall and buff male wolves are standing in front of the cabin, a female wolf who looks just as buff as the male ones with them. They’re all alphas. By now Jimin can distinguish them well. They’re more rough-looking than the other wolves. Jimin doubts they’re there for him. One alpha is more than enough to stop Jimin from escaping, two at most. Which means they’re here to subdue Jungkook if need be. The thought only scares Jimin, twisting Jimin’s stomach into knots. His head starts pounding but he ignores it. It might not matter soon anyway.

The female wolf doesn’t react when Jimin steps outside but the male wolves either sigh, shake their head or roll their eyes. Their disapproval and disbelief are clearly visible on their faces. They are led past multiple cabins and further into pack territory until they are standing in front of a gathered crowd. It looks like everyone has come to watch what is about to happen, whispering and glancing curiously at Jimin, while he has no idea what fate awaits him.

A few feet away from the crowd is the head alpha, multiple other wolves at his sides. They stand in front of them with their backs to the crowd. To the side, the one Jungkook stands on, are a few wolves of all ages. Judging by their grieving expressions and the hate that flares up when they see Jimin, he can only guess them to be the victim’s family. Everyone falls silent when Jimin and Jungkook come to a stop in front of the head alpha who is quietly watching Jungkook.

Jimin has talked to the head alpha before. During an attack on the village, Jimin had taken over command after their leader was killed, and, once everything had turned quiet, turned around to find the head alpha staring at him in his human form.

“You’re skilled,” he had said with that calm, detached way of his. “It’s a shame you’re not one of us.”

Jimin still thinks the head alpha is kind but aloof. He always seems far away, saying little but always something impressive. He is wise despite only being in his forties.

“So you seem intent on protecting the human,” the head alpha speaks up, and though his voice is low, it booms over the whole place. “Even if it means disobeying your pack.”

“I’ve always been quite the romantic. You know that,” Jungkook responds with a self-satisfied smile. It kills Jimin to see it. Shouldn’t he be showing at least some remorse?

The head alpha’s eyes wander over to Jimin, the same quiet aloofness in them. It’s as if nothing from this world can touch him, and Jimin again finds himself admiring him. He walks towards Jimin, authoritative despite being smaller than the alphas keeping Jungkook under guard, and stops in front of him. Jimin resists the urge to look at Jungkook for guidance. When the head alpha raises his hand, Jimin half-expects him to strike him down and half to kill him right there. Instead, the alpha moves his chin slightly to the left.

Oh, Jimin thinks, he’s inspecting the bite. And suddenly, Jimin feels insecure and wants to hide in the cabin again. It feels wrong to have someone look at it. No! To have someone else other than Jungkook look at it.

Seeming satisfied, the head alpha lets go of Jimin and steps in front of Jungkook, eyes raking over his neck and shoulders. “It’s a one-way bond,” he remarks.

“For now,” Jungkook says through gritted teeth, “and regardless of that, Jimin is bound to me now. He is one of the pack now. So, you either accept him as such or kill us both; like the rules demand.”

Jimin’s eyes widen upon hearing that, head whipping around to look at Jungkook. Jungkook would get killed with him? If the pack decides to kill Jimin, Jungkook would die too.

“There are exceptions. Mates don’t always get killed together,” the head alpha points out.

“If you don’t kill me, then I will kill myself.”

Sighing, the head alpha goes back to his spot between the members of the elders council. Then he looks at Jimin. “Welcome to the pack.”

Jimin has no time to process the words, too stunned, when someone interjects loudly, “No! You can’t be serious.”

One of the wolves, one of the younger ones, walks into the circle and glares at Jimin menacingly. “I refuse to accept this.”

She takes another step towards Jimin but then Jungkook is there, pushing her back and quite literally growling into her face.

“You talk to me. Not to my mate.”

The female wolf scoffs. “I think we’re far past talking. I demand a duel.”

The silence is broken, the crowd talking loudly amongst them. Some talk about how tragic this is, whereas others holler and call for a fight.

Jungkook smirks, looking as if this is the best thing that could’ve happened to him. “Talk terms.”

“You win, I’ll back off. I win, I get to kill that freak myself.”

Jimin knows wolves have been referring to humans as freaks or even malformations since their existence, but it was never said to his face before. His pack isn’t one to throw that word around easily but he supposes he can’t hope for that anymore.

“I accept.”

“Jungkook!” Jimin calls out appalled but his voice is drowned out by the cheers and the sudden movements that Jungkook’s declaration causes. Everyone starts walking backwards, clearing some place, for the duel apparently, and cheering on loudly. Someone even procures a drum from somewhere. The pounding in his head gets worse.

Jimin looks at the head alpha for help but he seems unmoved by the events playing out in front of him. Someone pulls at Jimin’s sleeves, gently leading him away from the middle.

“You should give them some space,” the wolf whispers, leading Jimin to a lightly crowded place and stands next to him.

“We should stop them,” Jimin says, looking up at the wolf.

One of the corners of the wolf’s mouth rises and he looks at Jimin as if he’s looking at a child. “You still have a lot to learn. Unless for a good reason, it’s cowardly to refuse a duel, and trust me, this is the best-case scenario for you two.”

“He could die. How’s that for a reason?”

“Not good enough.”

Jimin scoffs, and this time the wolf smiles at him with a genuine smile. “You’ll learn all this.”

Shaking his head, Jimin looks at the spectacle taking place in front of him. There was no way he could’ve ever guessed this would happen. Jungkook and the female wolf – who is an alpha, Jimin knows by now – have barely taken off their clothes, when they turn into wolves, skin ripping and bones cracking. This process, Jimin will never get used to, no matter how many times he witnesses it.

Without waiting for anyone’s word, the wolves lunge at each other, fletching their teeth and trying to bite the other. Jimin has only ever witnessed wolves fighting in the war years ago and it was brutal, but this right now isn’t any better. These are pack members. Aren’t they supposed to be looking out for each other?

“How can this be the best-case scenario?” Jimin asks as Jungkook bites down on the female wolf’s leg, drawing blood. The female wolf howls, kicking Jungkook with one of her hind legs.

“When Jungkook wins, the other party will have to drop their complaints and never speak of them again. And if they still come after you, they’ll be punished for it."

When. So the, surprisingly kind, wolf next to him is convinced Jungkook is going to win. Jimin is no specialist on wolf fights but even he can tell that Jungkook does have the upper hand. The female wolf has far more wounds that Jungkook, limping on one leg, whereas Jungkook was only bit twice and is barely bleeding from one of the wounds.

The fight doesn’t last much longer after that. Jungkook manages to overpower the female wolf and throws her on the ground, teeth sinking into her neck. Jimin closes his eyes and looks away. Everyone else is deadly silent for a moment and then they’re breaking out into cheers, the drum roll starting up again.

Someone pokes him in the sides and Jimin opens his eyes, staring up at the wolf. “Look,” the wolf says, motioning to Jungkook with his head. “He’s fine.”

Back in his human form, Jimin can tell that he indeed is fine. He sighs, shoulders sagging with relief.

Jungkook won.

He’s walking over to Jimin, one of his sides bleeding, the female wolf’s blood on his mouth. It doesn’t look like he cares though. He walks over to Jimin, the wolf next to Jimin patting Jungkook on the shoulder, and then looks at Jimin.

“You okay?” he asks.

Jimin blinks. He’s not. “A bit dizzy,” Jimin replies and averts his eyes when they land on Jungkook’s crotch. They had been naked with each other just this night but, if he’s being honest, he can’t remember much of it.

Jungkook cups Jimin’s cheek, startling Jimin. He blinks at the alpha and wonders whether that is concern in his eyes.

“Lets go rest. We shouldn’t even be out here.” He turns to the wolf and says,” Thanks for keeping an eye on him.”

“Any time. The name’s Taehyung, by the way,” the wolf tells Jimin and then walks away.

Back at the cabin, Jimin asks, “Is this where you live?”

Jungkook is wearing pants now, his side and mouth wiped, and is inspecting the wound in a mirror.

“Yes. We both will now,” Jungkook replies with a look towards Jimin.

Jimin averts his eyes, taking a closer look at the cabin. The front door leads directly into the living room, where Jimin is sitting on a couch. It looks cosy and clean, which Jimin hadn’t expected from the alpha.

“Bathroom is on the left,” Jungkook says, now turned to Jimin, upper body still naked. “Kitchen on the right. You know where the bedroom is already and the other room is a store room for now.”

Jimin wants to argue with Jungkook. He wants to pick up their conversation from before and yell at Jungkook for what he did to him but he doesn’t have the energy for it. He’s on edge, antsy and for some reason he can’t stop thinking that he needs to be back in bed; fluff it all up, make it cosy and warm, and stay inside.

Jungkook is in the middle of saying something but Jimin isn’t in the mood to listen. He gets up without a word and enters the bedroom, closing the door loudly behind him and crawls under the blanket. The message is clear. Do not enter.

This is how Jimin spends his first day in Jungkook’s cabin and as a new member of the pack: staying in bed all day while Jungkook leaves meals in front of the door for him. He goes inside once night has fallen, and Jimin bristles, even more so when Jungkook sits on the bed. Jimin is laying on his stomach so he can’t see it but he can feel Jungkook’s gaze on him.

“I know you want me to keep my distance but that won’t go well with the mating bite,” Jungkook says.

Jimin doesn’t respond but he also doesn’t object when Jungkook slips under the blanket and lays down next him, close but not touching him. The bed isn’t big and Jimin is occupying most of it, refusing to move even a centimetre, but Jungkook doesn’t complain. A part of Jimin is happy about the alpha being next to him. Jimin quenches that flame as soon it takes form. He will never forgive the alpha.

That’s what Jimin was at least hoping to stick to. He avoids Jungkook as much as possible but he can’t deny that gradually those times are reducing. The next days are spent in a similar fashion, Jimin in the bedroom most of the time and when Jungkook leaves, he steps out of the room, giving Jungkook the silent treatment but glad that the alpha still sleeps next to him.

They are the most confusing days of Jimin’s life so far. He’s glad he’s not dead but he’s mad about the situation he is in. He isn’t as mad as he used to be, Jimin notes one day, and then that makes him only angrier. There is no way he can ever forgive Jungkook. He shouldn’t ever do that but he can’t help but be touched by the alpha’s care and attention. He takes care of Jimin, feeds him, forces him out of bed when he’s in it for too long, talked to Jimin’s parents for him, and does those little things that make Jimin’s heart flutter.

It’s infuriating.

The one night, maybe a week after Jimin got pardoned and started living with Jungkook, does he burst, flinging the plate of food that Jungkook set in front off the tiny table in the kitchen. Jimin is shaking, breathing ragged. The confusion is too much on that day and he’s ready to burst, too many conflicting feelings and too many unsaid words locked inside him.

Jungkook puts his spoon on the table and leans back in his chair, regarding Jimin with a cool look. Almost as if he has been expecting this. He remains silent as Jimin glares at him.

“I hate you,” Jimin chokes out.

Jungkook’s eyes widen a bit and Jimin instantly regrets saying the words but a part of him is happy despite the pang of guilt he feels.

“I hate you so fucking much. How can you just sit here and live like everything’s normal when you’ve uprooted my whole life?”

“What else should I do?” Jungkook asks, disarming Jimin with the question. “The sun keeps rising and setting, day turns into night and night into day. This world doesn’t stop for anyone. No matter what we do. All we can do is keep living, and you should too.”

“What?” Jimin scoffs and gets to his feet, too antsy to sit silently. “Here in your pack?”

“Our pack.”

“I’m basically a prisoner. I can’t meet my parents or my friends. Everyone out there hates me for killing one of you, and I’m stuck here. With you. A complete stranger. Apparently for all life.”

“No one out there hates you. It’s all settled. We are even with them. All you need to do is open your heart a bit and step outside the cabin, and you’ll see they’re great wolves. And with time you will be allowed to see your family. I promise you.”

Jimin shakes his head. “Wolves. That’s the thing. You’re all wolves and I’m a human, a freak according to your laws. And do your promises even mean anything?”

“No one thinks like that anymore, not in our pack. And you’re a war hero. Everyone here respects you,” Jungkook says and gets to his feet. Jimin’s breath hitches with the first step Jungkook takes towards him but he remains where he is, staring up at the alpha when he stands in front of him.

“I’ll make sure you meet them,” Jungkook whispers comfortingly. Jimin doesn’t know what it is but he starts calming down a bit. “You just have to say it and I’ll do everything in my power to make it happen.”

“Why don’t you fuck off then?”

Jungkook’s lips curl into a small smile which only infuriates Jimin.

“I don’t regret saving you. I never will, and although this isn’t what you imagined, if you only open your heart to me, you’ll find you actually have nothing to hate about me. You can’t feel it but I can. We’re meant to be.”

Jimin stares at Jungkook, at a loss for words. He knows that dating and searching for a partner is all instinctual for wolves. They let themselves be led by their second natures and see what their chemistry with the partner is like but Jimin has no second nature. That’s why he can’t believe Jungkook. And he’s also not ready to forgive Jungkook just like that. So he chooses the most hurtful words he can think of and spits them into Jungkook’s face, “You should have just let me die that night. Or killed me. That would've been an act of kindness compared to what you've put me through.”

The smile on Jungkook’s face vanishes and something flashes in his eyes. Jimin ignores it and goes to back to the bedroom.

Jungkook doesn’t join him that night.



Jungkook is gone by the time Jimin wakes up and leaves his room. That makes him feel dejected. Seeing the plate of breakfast ready for him, only makes it worse. It takes him over half an hour to eat his breakfast. He can’t concentrate on it, his thoughts always straying to Jungkook. He sighs when he hears voices coming from outside, wishing he had the guts to leave this cabin. It surely would make him a lot less miserable.

He also hasn’t been able to sleep well, plagued by nightmares about the incident in the woods, and they only seem to be getting worse when Jungkook isn’t there. Jimin is glad Jungkook wasn’t with him this night but he’s also sulky.

A knock interrupts his thoughts, making him jump to his feet. Jimin waits for a moment with bated breath, wondering if he imagined it, but then there it is again, another knock. It’s not Jungkook. He just comes in because it’s his cabin. So it must be someone else, someone who’s probably looking for Jungkook because it can’t be for Jimin.

Having stalled enough, Jimin goes to the front door. He inhales deeply and opens the door, blinking multiple times when he sees Taehyung stand in front of him, big grin on his face.

“Hey!” he greets as if he’s meeting a childhood friend.

“Hey,” Jimin replies quietly.

“Can I come in?”

Jimin nods and opens the door more to let Taehyung inside, closing it after him. By the looks of it, Taehyung is Jungkook’s friend so it should okay and safe for Jimin to let him inside.

“How have you been?” Taehyung asks, sitting on the couch as if he’s done it hundreds of times. He probably has. Jimin takes a seat in front of him.

“Okay, I suppose… What about you?”

Taehyung smirks at Jimin’s awkward question but nods. “Fine. I’ve come to ask about your schedule.”

“My schedule?”

“The head alpha intends on giving you some tasks soon. He wanted to know when you’ll be available and what you can do.”

“Like outside the cabin?” Jimin asks slowly, brows furrowed.

Taehyung smiles again. “One of these days, you will have to come out. I’m sure it works the same way in your village and I know you’re a hard worker. We pull our own weight here. We don’t laze around while others do the work for us. You’re most probably dying in here, so why not just go out. It’ll also make a better impression if you come out of your own volition instead of being forced to do so by the head alpha.”

The wolf doesn’t look unkind when he says those words but looks like he genuinely wants to help him.

Jimin has the decency to look ashamed. He knows Taehyung is right. The head alpha and the pack have been very lenient with him, probably to give him time to get adjusted to the mating and to the pack but he will have to step out one day. And it really would make a better impression if Jimin were to do that willingly.

“What would I even do?” Jimin asks.

“What did you do back in your village?”

“Helped in the fields, helped my grandmother in the bakery, went fishing, hunting, repaired stuff. Anything I could do, I would.”

“That’s great. We have all that work here. Though you probably won’t be allowed to hunt anytime soon.”

Jimin expected that.

“I can talk to the head alpha. Ask him to assign you to places where I am for the beginning. Start you off slow. How does that sound?”

For some reason, Jimin nods without hesitation.

Taehyung smiles brightly, slapping Jimin’s arm once. “Great. Looking forward to working with you.”

“Yeah,” Jimin whispers, and then adds, “Why are you doing this?”

Taehyung looks puzzled. “Because you’re one of us now.”

“Yeah but you’re the only one who came here to actively talk to me.”

“Because you’re Jungkook’s mate and Jungkook is my friend, and just as I thought I can finally have some peace from Jungkook being infatuated with you, he’s out there sulking all day. And I like making new friends.”

Jimin is unsure how to react to load of new information Taehyung gave him about Jungkook.

“Also because I really don’t want Jungkook to go die,” Taehyung adds, interrupting Jimin’s train of thought.

Jimin raises his eyebrows questioningly. “You’re saying Jungkook would have really killed himself? Because of me?”

Taehyung stares at him with a deadpan look for a second, looking as if he can’t believe how stupid Jimin is. Then he says, “Not downright committed suicide but he would have challenged the head alpha to a duel and fought until he either killed the head alpha and then maybe committed suicide or fought until he died. It looks like you still don’t believe that Jungkook likes you.”

Jimin lowers his head, letting the remark go uncommented. He can’t think about it all now. It only confuses him more.

“I’ll pick you up tomorrow, okay? I’m working the fields, so I suppose that’s a good start.” Taehyung says, leaving afterwards.



Just like he promised, Taehyung picks him up the next day right after breakfast. Jungkook had spent last night back in bed but he had left before Jimin woke up, a plate of breakfast awaiting Jimin in the kitchen like usual. After Taehyung’s word from the day before, the plate looked differently to Jimin now. He can’t stop thinking about the work and care Jungkook put into providing for Jimin like this.

Jimin changes into his clothes, his parents having dropped them off a few days ago, and takes his first step outside in a long while, heart loudly beating against his chest. He wishes Jungkook were with him.

“You’ll get some stares,” Taehyung says on their way to the fields, “but that’s only because you’ve been hiding in your cabin until now and everyone is curious how the mating with a human is going.”

Jimin doesn’t need to be told about the stares. He was already getting those from the few wolves he encountered on their way but that didn’t prepare him for the stares he gets when he arrives at the fields. Multiple wolves are there, most of them shirtless because it’s noon already and it’s hot, and a silence falls over them when they see Jimin. Some raise their eyebrows, others begin whispering, but all of them stare.

“They should be happy Jungkook isn’t here,” Taehyung mutters and hands Jimin the necessary tools. “You know what to do?”

Jimin looks around and nods, getting to work immediately. He’s glad it’s hard work. It requires little to no interaction with others and he’s easily distracted from thinking about Jungkook. He hears the wolves talking amongst them but unless Taehyung addresses Jimin, he doesn’t participate. He gets rid of his shirt halfway through his work, working only in his tanktop. The whistling doesn’t go unnoticed by him.

Water gets passed around and Jimin is surprised when one of the wolves offers him a bottle. Jimin stares at the shirtless, sweaty alpha, stunned, wipes the sweat from his forehead and accepts the bottle.

“Thank you,” he mumbles, taking a few sips from the bottle without touching it with his lips, he hands the bottle back. He’s still thirsty but he doesn’t want to finish it in case the others haven’t drunk yet.

The alpha winks at Jimin when he hands the bottle back. Jimin blinks, head tilting in confusion. Taehyung shakes his head.

It’s dinner by the time they’re done, and Jungkook is waiting for him. Jimin doesn’t know what to do so he sheepishly follows Taehyung when he walks towards Jungkook.

“Hey,” Jungkook greets Jimin softly when he reaches him

It makes Jimin’s heart quiver. “Hey,” he greets back just as softly. Taehyung is acting as if he isn’t there.

“I wasn’t able to cook today. Do you feel up to eating in the communal hall with everyone else?”

Jimin looks down at himself, the dirt and sweat. “Shouldn’t I shower first?”

“It’s already late and nothing will be left by the time you’re done.”

“No one cares about that,” Taehyung adds when Jimin still looks sceptical. “I’m going like this too. You can clean up by the well like everyone else.”

Jimin nods and walks over to the well where other wolves are lingering around, drinking and washing up. He’s hesitant about going there alone, more so because Jimin can feel that most of them are alphas, but he’s too proud to ask Jungkook or Taehyung to accompany him. So he swallows his discomfort and pulls up a bucket of water for himself.

Jimin cleans his hands first and then splashes water into his face quickly. He would like to be more thorough with his washing but he can feel someone’s gaze on him, so he stops. It annoys him. Jimin should probably ignore it and leave because he’s hungry after so much work but he wants this to be the last time someone stares at him. That’s why he looks up at the alpha defiantly while a few others watch with interest.

“You wanna say something?” Jimin asks.

Some of the wolves give low ‘ooohs’ from them as if egging them on to fight but Jimin ignores them. The alpha’s grin widens and he leans down until his face is close to Jimin’s, whispering in a low voice, “You know how you look?”

Jimin just stares at him with narrowed eyes.

“Like a pretty omega.”

Jimin inhales sharply, turning beet red for some reason. He feels humiliated, and the alpha’s satisfied smirk doesn’t help. He wants to say something, cuss the alpha out or even punch him, but before he can do any of that, someone steps up behind Jimin, wrapping an arm around his waist.

“Fuck off,” Jungkook growls.

The alpha raises his hands in a defensive manner, and all of them leave but the smirks are still plastered on their faces.

“You okay?” Jungkook asks once they’re gone.

Jimin nods. He can still feel some heat in his cheeks but the embarrassment is replaced by a tingling feeling caused by Jungkook’s arm around him. Their alpha protected them.

Jimin blinks. Then shakes his head. What an odd thought to have.

“Shall we?” Jimin asks, turning to Jungkook.

Jungkook nods and leads the way. Jimin slips his shirt on, Jungkook’s hand falling from his waist. The spot feels cold after the loss of Jungkook’s touch. The silence that ensues after Jimin enters the communal hall is worse than when he went to the fields. Wolves nudge their partners, point at Jimin with their utensils and stare openly. The fact that Jungkook squares up to his full height and protects Jimin from the gazes as much as possible with his body is huge a relief.

Jungkook guides him to the buffet, giving him a plate, while Taehyung follows obediently. Jimin is glad to have Taehyung at his back. He doesn’t expect to be attacked but he supposes that if others see Jimin be treated normally by at least one wolf, they will follow suit. Jimin expects to sit at an empty table but instead they sit next to two other wolves.

“Finally out huh?” one of them asks Jimin with a bright smile. Jimin is too stunned by his good looks to speak. “I’m Seokjin.”

Jimin clears his throat and sits next to Jungkook, and if he’s sitting a little too close, well, no one can blame him. “Jimin.”

“Yoongi,” the second wolf says around a big bite of his food.

“Yoongi is one of the healer’s in the pack,” Jungkook explains. “He and Taehyung are mates. Another friend is currently travelling.”

“He’s a shy one,” Taehyung says with a big grin next to Yoongi, to which Yoongi responds by elbowing him in the side.

“Not shy. Just don’t like talking so much shit.”

Jimin smiles at the casual talk, getting more relaxed. At least he won’t be getting indigestion today. He’s not confident enough to contribute to the conversation, so he listens quietly, trying not to think too much.

“We’ll be in the kitchens tomorrow, I heard,” Seokjin suddenly says, addressing Jimin.

Jimin swallows his bite and shrugs. “I don’t know anything about my schedule.”

“It’s not fixed yet,” Jungkook explains, giving Jimin a large piece of meat from his own plate. He does so naturally that Jimin is a bit confused and a bit flustered. “Head Alpha said to see how you’re doing today and, if you feel up for it, let you decide if you want to do it.”

“I’m not much help in the kitchen, to be honest,” Jimin says apologetically.

“How about pups?” Taehyung asks

It gets quiet on the table for a moment. Jungkook, who was leading the spoon to his mouth, freezes while something inside Jimin stirs. He notes how everyone throws Jungkook a glance and looks at the alpha too. Jungkook takes the bite into his mouth and blinks at Jimin.

“I mean, if you’d like, you can also help at the nursery. That’s where I am when I’m not needed for alpha stuff.”

“Tae is one of the few alphas who prefer being in the nursery,” Yoongi chimes in.

“Whereas Yoongi is one of the rare omegas who’d rather die than go there,” Taehyung counters with a smitten smile on his face, leaning in close to Yoongi to nuzzle his cheek. Yoongi doesn’t react to it other than looking a bit pleased. Jimin is a bit embarrassed by the public display of affection.

“I’m okay with… pups,” Jimin says after the Taehyung is content with nuzzling Yoongi, a little hesitant to say the last word. That’s not what they call children in his village.

“Then nursery it is.”

“No fair. When do I get to work with Jimin?” Seokjin throws in.

Jimin watches them, a bit overwhelmed, a bit lost. By the time they finish their meal, Jimin is glad to finally be on his way home so he can take a shower.

“You alright?” Jungkook asks on the way. He’s walking next to Jimin, Jimin content with how it is.

Jimin doesn’t know how to feel about how well Jungkook reads him but he certainly is pleased with the attention for some reason.

“I’m just… confused.” Jimin decides to be truthful. “Everyone is either nice or at least open. I guess, I just expected more hostility.”

“Head Alpha forgave you. Being hostile towards you is equal to disobeying him. And I won the duel. That makes everything even.”

“So everyone forgot about… it? Just like that?” Jimin asks, disconcerted.

“We didn’t forget. We just moved past it. You’re part of the pack now.”

Jimin has heard these words so many times but still has difficulty believing them.

“It’s really this easy?”

“This is how we work.”

Jimin remains silent after that, mulling over Jungkook’s words. Jungkook lets Jimin shower first, and Jimin spends that time thinking about the day. Pack life isn’t so bad. It’s almost the same as living in the village, and with the pack members being rather open towards him, Jimin doesn’t have much anything to complain about. He feels like he actually has a shot at a good life here.

Then there is Jungkook.

Soft, gentle, caring Jungkook.

Strong, reliable, nurturing Jungkook.

Handsome, fit, sexy Jungkook.

Jimin shakes his head, switching the water from warm to cold to calm down. Since when did Jimin only think of positive things when he thinks about Jungkook? Truthfully? He has never had anything against Jungkook. Hell, he was even interested in the alpha before all this happened but it was rather physical and now he’s suddenly married to Jungkook.

Shit, Jimin is married to Jungkook. Mating is equal to marriage, only even more intense.

Jimin has a small panic attack after that realisation. Jimin is married. To a man he doesn’t know but he’s married. Oh damn.

Jimin startles when he hears two knocks on the door.

“You okay?” Jungkook asks from the other side of the door.

Shit. That’s his husband.

Mate, something inside Jimin chants and he gasps at that thought.

“Jimin?” Jungkook sounds worried now, ready to break in the door.

“I-I’m fine. I just have to put my clothes on.”

“Okay. Call me if you need anything.”

“Yeah.”

Jimin hurriedly dries himself off and puts his clothes but leaves the bathroom rather hesitantly. He will have to face Jungkook now and he doesn’t know if he can do that. He stalls in the bathroom door, wondering what to do now, when Jungkook suddenly appears in front of him. Jimin flinches, staring up at Jungkook wide-eyed.

“Jimin, are you sure you’re alright?”

Hearing and seeing the worry on Jungkook’s face does things to Jimin he never thought possible. It’s like a storm is raging inside of him; happiness, content and confusion creating a turmoil in him.

“I am,” Jimin says a tad too loudly and rushes past Jungkook. He immediately regrets his outburst, embarrassed by it, but it’s too late now anyway.

Lost about what to do, Jimin readies himself for bed even though he isn’t tired. He’s worked hard today so he hopes sleep will come before Jungkook is done. His wish doesn’t get fulfilled though. He still wide awake when Jungkook enters the bedroom. Jimin keeps his eyes firmly closed and snuggles into the blanket, back towards Jungkook. Jungkook crawls under the blanket with him, no doubt shirtless again. Like every other night too.

It’s quiet for a long while so Jimin turns around to check on Jungkook before getting for a glass of water. He freezes when he’s met with Jungkook’s open eyes and smug smile.

“Are you going to run away again?” Jungkook asks, voice low.

Jimin thought the alpha might be upset but he looks excited instead, almost like a child happy about playing a game of catch. Almost like a hunter enjoying running after his prey.

Jimin gulps, remembering the lesson about how alphas are predators. He remains silent and shakes his head.

Jungkook supports his head on his hand and fixes Jimin with his gaze. “What’s wrong? You’re weird today.”

“I’m not,” Jimin whispers defensively. Not even he believes himself.

“Want to break another plate?”

Jimin bristles and glares at Jungkook disbelievingly.

“Relax,” Jungkook breathes and ups Jimin’s cheek with one hand, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. “You can if you want to, and yell too.”

“You’re weird,” Jimin mumbles, regret and shame audible in his voice.

Jungkook chuckles. “Maybe but if that’s what helps my mate deal with the current situation then I’ll happily forfeit some plates.”

“And your life too, apparently,” Jimin says without thinking. It’s then that he notices how bothered he was about how easily Jungkook is willing to give up his life for him.

“If that’s what you want.”

“It’s not!”

Jimin surprises Jungkook and himself with his loud protest, hand raising to clutch at Jungkook’s. He’s angry and appalled by how Jungkook smiled when he said those words.

“Stop talking like that,” Jimin hisses and turns his back to Jungkook. Their first normal conversation and Jungkook had to ruin it like that.

Jimin hears some rustling behind him, Jungkook inching closer until he’s almost engulfing Jimin with his body, his lips at Jimin’s ear.

“I’m sorry. Don’t be mad, please,” Jungkook pleads breathily.

Jimin closes his eyes and bites his lower lip. Jungkook sounds so needy and sweet, and maybe Jimin likes Jungkook trying to make it up to him a tad too much. He likes the attention but he would never admit that.

Jungkook’s hand hovers over Jimin’s side but seemingly discouraged by Jimin’s lack of response, Jungkook goes back to his side of the bed and whispers a quiet good night.



Life gets more peaceful for Jimin because something changes between the two of them after that night. Jungkook becomes a constant in his life. He stays for breakfast and has it with Jimin, sometimes in silence, sometimes over a pleasant conversation about nothing in particular. With Jungkook as an active part of his life, life in the pack becomes easier for Jimin. Jungkook is a great and knowledgeable wolf to have at his side, and the more Jimin gets to know about him, the more he’s alright with living at Jungkook’s side.

He hasn’t forgiven him but he can look past that incident most of the time. It’s not all great, and some days Jimin refuses to speak to Jungkook at all, but with Jungkook’s help, Jimin becomes a constant in the pack. Jimin doesn’t fit in perfectly. It’s like something is stopping him from accepting this new life and it’s not all Jungkook.

Jimin doesn’t mind the changes. He actually likes it but he still resists it. He still can’t forgive the circumstances that lead to Jimin being a part of the pack, and Jungkook knows it too. It shows in moments when Jimin is laughing at something Jungkook said and suddenly he stops. Or when they’re having a nice conversation and Jimin closes himself off out of nowhere.

“You’ve been working hard,” Jungkook says to Jimin one evening when he’s picking him up from the fields again.

Jimin has befriended some of the wolves there by now, even gets along with the jerk who called him an omega.

“It’s work,” Jimin says. “It’s nice. Keeps me from going crazy.”

“Well, sorry to inform you that you won’t be working tomorrow,” Jungkook teases him. Jimin rolls his eyes. “I have a small trip planned for us.”

“What trip?”

“It’s a surprise. We’ll be going after lunch. I still have work before that but you’re free.”

Jimin tries to get the answer multiple times that night but nothing can make the alpha budge or slip up. His smug and self-satisfied smirk doesn’t help reduce Jimin’s curiosity at all.

The next morning when Jimin wakes up, he’s laying close to the alpha, the alpha facing him. Jimin has noted with calm acceptance that this has been happening more and more. While in the past there used to be a lot of space between them and Jimin was mostly turned away from Jungkook, now they’re always facing each other and sometimes Jimin wakes up with his face only inches away from Jungkook’s. Jimin slowly inches away from Jungkook and leaves the room quietly.

Waiting for Jungkook to wake up is boring so he starts preparing breakfast already, done in time for the alpha to step out of the room.

“Someone’s up early,” the alpha comments in a husky voice, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. “Excited?”

Jimin sticks his tongue out at Jungkook which only makes him laugh. This has also become a part of their lives: Jungkook teasing him regularly.

The alpha leaves soon after, promising to be back around lunchtime. Jimin has never been very patient but today he’s even worse. He keeps on checking when Jungkook will come back and can’t sit still for more than a few minutes.

It’s because it’s my first trip with Jungkook, Jimin realises and bites his lower lip. He tries to be more patient after, tries to be indifferent, but he sighs relieved when Jungkook finally comes back to pick him up.

Even on their way through the woods, Jungkook does not explain where they’re headed, but they are getting closer and closer to human territory. He’s about to explode and demand Jungkook tell him where they’re going when he spots three familiar figures between the trees. He stays still for a moment, Jungkook waiting with him silently, and then runs towards them.

His parents and Hoseok meet him halfway, immediately throwing their arms around him. Jimin is crying by the time he hugs his mother, then his father and lastly Hoseok.

“Fuck, Jiminie, the things you get yourself into,” Hoseok breathes through his own tears.

Jimin chuckles and hugs his best friend tighter. Taehyung is a great friend to have but the alpha is and always will be Jungkook’s friend first.

“How?” Jimin asks Jungkook once he’s done hugging his parents and Hoseok. The alpha is standing to the side, letting them have their moment.

“Head Alpha gave permission because you were working really hard. He has always admired you and your behaviour has shown him you’re a great addition to the pack.”

“So I can visit my village?”

The smile drops from Jungkook’s face. That’s all the answer Jimin needs.

“Not now,” Jungkook says apologetically and strokes Jimin’s hair with one hand, “but one day. I promise.”

Jimin nods and wipes his tears away. Jungkook keeps his promises.

Jimin’s parents have prepared a picnic and they happily ask Jungkook to join them. Jimin watches silently as he sees the scene play out, sees the trust his parents are showing in Jungkook. It’s something Jimin wished his parents to show in his future partner.

They eat and laugh and catch up, Jimin’s parents telling Jimin what he missed and telling Jungkook embarrassing stories from his past. It’s nice and cosy, and then Hoseok is pulling him for a walk for some privacy.

“So, how’s life in a pack?” Hoseok asks the same question his parents because he wants a less sugar-coated version of it.

“It’s okay,” Jimin says matter of factly. “Almost like life in a village. I have almost all my previous responsibilities other than not being allowed to hunt, and the fact that people randomly shift into wolves.”

“Must be freaky.”

“It is but it’s my life now.”

“How is having a mate?”

“It’s only half a bond but it’s… I don’t know. I feel so much since he bit me and everything’s much more intense.”

“Yeah?”

“And I want to hate him but it’s hard,” Jimin admits quietly.

“Well, he’s your mate. We don’t really get it, and I do less than even you now, but you know what teacher said, that a bond is a connection of the souls that lets you share in his feelings and life.”

“Yeah, but I’m human. And it doesn’t feel like I feel his feelings but more like I feel a different part of me every time he’s in the room.”

Hoseok stops and forces Jimin to face him. Jimin prepares for the hard truth.

“You may be human but this is your life now. You’ve always felt attracted to him and it’s okay to give him a chance.”

“You don’t know what he did,” Jimin protests.

“He drugged and forcedly mated you?”

Jimin’s defences break down and he stares at Hoseok. “How did you know?”

“He told us. Came clean right in the first meeting, and trust me, I was so mad I punched him.”

“You did?”

“Yeah, and I’m still alive and so are you, and hell if I’m not glad about that. The price for it was high but you shouldn’t make your life harder than it already is.”

Jimin lets the words settle and puts them in a safe drawer for now. “I’ll try,” he tells Hoseok.

They wander for a bit more but soon have to make their way back. Jimin bids goodbye to everyone, sad but hopeful as he follows Jungkook.

“Thank you,” he says after a while. “That means a lot.”

“You’re welcome.”

“How come I’ve never met your parents? Not worth bringing me home?” Jimin jokes. He’s in a good mood. Sue him.

“They’re dead.”

Jimin’s smile vanishes and he grabs Jungkook’s small finger with his hand. Jungkook stares at him wide-eyed, taken off guard by the sudden touch.

“I’m sorry.”

Jungkook huffs and holds Jimin’s hand, dragging him along as he starts walking again. “It was a long time ago. My omega mom died from a bad case of pneumonia and my alpha mom died in the war five years ago.”

“Jungkook, I’m so sorry,” Jimin apologises again and squeezes his hand.

“What are you apologising for? I’ve made my peace with it somewhat but I never want to lose anyone I care about every again.”

Call him delusional, but Jimin feels like the words are meant for him, a sort of explanation why he did what he did that night.

While Jimin accepts Jungkook’s explanation, one part of his sentence won’t leave him alone.

“I want to apologise,” Jimin blurts out two days after meeting his family over lunch. They’re at home this time, probably because Jungkook noticed that Jimin is on edge.

Jungkook looks at Jimin and waits patiently for him to elaborate.

“I want to apologise to the family of the wolf I killed. I want to make my peace with it and give his family a chance to do so too.”

Jimin had been plagued by another nightmare that night, so bad he had woken Jungkook and the wolf had held him as he cried.

Jungkook nods. “I’ll talk to them, arrange something so they’re prepared.”

And that’s what he does. Not even a twenty-four hours later Jimin is sitting in the living room of the aggrieved family, Jungkook at his side. The alpha wouldn’t let him do this alone. It was his one condition. The female alpha who had asked Jungkook for a duel is present too, not as angry as before but it’s still there.

“I know, I have no right to be here,” Jimin begins shakily, looks at the female wolf and at the parents, “and nothing I say will bring back your son but I couldn’t let this be done with the duel. I… regret being careless that day and that my carelessness took someone precious from you. I shouldn’t have been so stubborn. I’m truly sorry for killing your son.”

“We don’t blame you,” the father speaks up. “It was a mistake and many of us have made mistakes because of stupid actions.”

“I can’t say we’ll become great neighbours,” the other says, wiping he tears and sniffling, “but you have nothing to fear from us. I sued to blame you but like my husband said, it was just a mistake. He would’ve forgiven you too.”

Jimin tried to keep the tears in but that breaks the dam. Jungkook leans over to hold his hand.

The female alpha speaks up next, and Jimin mentally prepares himself to hear accusations and get insulted but that’s not what happens. “You’re right,” she says. “It was a stupid mistake and that’s what’s so infuriating. I wanted to hate and blame you for my brother’s death because it needed to make sense somehow, but I couldn’t. Because you’re not to blame.”

Jimin nods, more tears streaming down his face. He doesn’t stay much after that, apologises again, and lets Jungkook lead him back to their cabin. Jungkook stays with him for the rest of the day and holds him when they go to bed. Jimin falls asleep in his arms.



Jungkook grows more affectionate, touching Jimin lightly whenever he finds the opportunity but never too much or inappropriately. Once he even gives Jimin a pretty bracelet, trying to look nonchalant when doing so. And he smiles more. A lot more. And just like that, Jimin’s days are filled with more light than he could’ve imagined.

They find a certain comfortableness where Jimin doesn’t mind being with Jungkook anymore. He laughs with Jungkook without holding back, talks to him, and even teases him. That is until a certain morning when Jimin wakes up in Jungkook’s arms, back firmly pressed to the alpha’s chest and firmly trapped in his hold.

Jimin lets himself slowly wake up but when he tries to remove the alpha’s arms carefully, Jungkook refuses to budge. Jimin puts effort into removing Jungkook’s arms but he only makes a protesting sound and presses Jimin closer to himself. Jimin gasps and gives in to the voice telling him to remain in their mate’s arms but only for a second. Jimin becomes painfully aware of the alpha’s half-naked state, and how it’s no help for the growing problem in his pants.

“Jungkook,” Jimin breathes, can’t manage anything more than that.

Jungkook hums and buries his nose deeper into back of his neck, lips brushing the sensitive skin momentarily. If it were possible, Jungkook’s hold on him tightens even more, pinning him to the bed. Jimin doesn’t know if he imagines it but Jungkook’s scent seems to grow heavier, more potent, and it addles Jimin’s mind.

Jimin hiccups and forgets how to breathe when Jungkook presses a kiss to the back of his neck, leaving one kiss after another. Jungkook seems unaware of it, still fast asleep as he leaves another kiss. When he attempts to slip out of his arms again, the alpha growls warningly, teeth sinking into the skin of his neck. The sound goes straight into Jimin’s gut, making his cock twitch. The bite stirs something primal in Jimin and he moans loudly.

His hand flies to his mouth to silence the sound but it’s too late. It’s already and it makes Jungkook stir from his sleep.

“Jimin?” he sleepily mumbles, loosening his hold on the man.

Jimin bolts, not waiting for Jungkook to wake up and ask him about anything that happened. He locks himself in the bathroom, panting and cock achingly hard. Jungkook doesn’t come after him, by now knowing when Jimin needs his distance.

Jimin takes a couple of minutes to calm down, and it’s after he has, does he notice something weird. He puts his hand inside his pants, fingers reaching between his cheeks. When he pulls them back out again, they’re wet.

The peaceful, though laden, co-existence Jimin had built with Jungkook shatters that morning.



“Why are you doing this?” Taehyung asks him after the third consecutive day Jimin has been avoiding Jungkook.

They’ve been taking a break from repairing the roof of one of the cabin’s when Jimin’s eyes glued themselves to Jungkook who is chopping wood. Is shirtless while chopping wood. While so many other wolves are staring at him. Most of them omegas.

“What?” Jimin asks and turns to Taehyung. He knows what Taehyung is talking about but he won’t admit to it that easily.

Taehyung gives him a deadpan look, not believing his act for a second. “Why are you making Jungkook and yourself miserable by resisting him? You obviously have the hots for him.”

“Do not!” Jimin protests, jaw falling open and eyebrows.

It’s not like Jimin wants to avoid Jungkook but it’s all a bit too much for him. First he accidentally kills someone, then he gets forcedly mated, then he’s all confused about everything and now his body is acting up.

“Yeah, right. Lets say you don’t, you still can’t allow yourself to stay away from him. You’re mated to him. You’re carrying his bite. You crave him, and don’t say you don’t,” Taehyung adds hastily when Jimin opens his mouth to refuse. “I’m a wolf. I know more about mating bites than you ever could in that human village of yours, and I have personal experience. Staying away from him will bite you in the ass.”

Jimin doesn’t crave Jungkook. He’s interested in the alpha, yes, but he does not crave him.

“I’m a human,” Jimin says after a long silence.

Taehyung rolls his eyes and gets to his feet. “A mating bite is strong. I believe in the power of it. And humans are descendants of wolves too. You’d be smart to remember that.”

“I’ve had enough wolf lessons from you,” Jimin says and walks past him, and it’s true. Taehyung had been teaching Jimin more and more about wolves, about mating, and everything else that is involved, stuff like scenting.

They don’t talk for the remainder of their work, Jungkook also having stopped chopping wood and gone to somewhere else. Jimin’s annoyance is mostly gone when they say goodbye but he’s still a bit peeved. He only finds out the real reason after he goes back to his cabin – now able to go through the pack by himself – and finds Jungkook working outside. Still very much shirtless.

Jimin doesn’t know what comes over him. He stomps inside, ignoring Jungkook’s puzzled look, and fills up a jug with cold water, marching outside again. Jungkook looks up from his work when Jimin stands next to him, and then Jimin is already emptying the whole jug over Jungkook’s head.

Jungkook gasps and jumps to his feet, staring at Jimin with wide eyes and an open mouth. “What the hell?” he exclaims, water dripping his hair, droplets cascading down his toned abs, almost caressing it.

Jimin hates how good Jungkook still looks and even more so when Jungkook pushes his hair back with one hand, creating art in the form of slicked back hair. He groans annoyed and stomps back inside.

Jungkook follows suit, looking confused and a bit concerned, and corners Jimin in the kitchen.

“Are you going to tell me what that was about?”

“About nothing,” Jimin hisses defensively and attempts to walk past Jungkook, and is disappointed when Jungkook grabs him by the waist and traps his against the counter. Jungkook has always let Jimin escape so Jimin can’t believe he won’t let the same happen again. He can’t deny that he’s excited too.

It’s been so long since he last touched Jungkook, since he last talked to him properly, and he does miss and yearn for it.

“The truth,” Jungkook demands, voice authoritative. He sounds like the alpha he is.

Jimin’s eyes rake over Jungkook’s body, the tan he got from the working in the sun and his abs. Jimin has spent a whole night doing all sorts of things with Jungkook in bed but he was frantic with need back then and didn’t have the time to appreciate Jungkook. But now, because Jungkook won’t stop walking around shirtlessly, anyone can gawk at him however they please. The thought makes something hot coil in his gut.

“Do you always walk around half-naked?” Jimin hisses before he can stop himself.

“Only when it’s hot outside and I’m working,” Jungkook explains, eyebrows furrowed.

“Oh, and not because of all the attention you get?”

Jimin regrets asking as soon as the words are out. His hope that Jungkook won’t catch on is in vain, his confusion replaced by a smug smirk as his face lights up.

“You’re jealous.” He says it like a fact and not like a question.

“No, I’m not,” Jimin protests and fights against Jungkook’s hold.

Jungkook tightens his hold on Jimin, pressing the man closer to himself. “Good boys don’t lie.”

Jimin squeaks, embarrassment already colouring his cheeks red. He presses his hands against Jungkook’s chest to push him away but he feels the heat of Jungkook, feels the hardness of his muscle, and decides against it. His hands slide down Jungkook’s torso, feelings the bumps and dips of his abs. Remembering how omegas had been staring at Jungkook just an hour ago, Jimin digs his nails into his stomach.

Jungkook hisses but doesn’t stop Jimin, lets him do as he pleases. Jimin removes his nails bloody and watches the tiny wounds heal slowly. He looks up at Jungkook and hums when the alpha presses his lips against Jimin’s. He wraps his arms around Jungkook’s shoulders, stands on his tiptoes and kisses Jungkook with fervour. He’s done denying himself the one thing he truly wants: Jungkook. So he opens his mouth, welcoming Jungkook’s tongue to explore and claim.

Jimin realises something else in that moment: Jungkook wants him. Desperately. Ravenously. This time is different though. This time, Jungkook isn’t taking him, Jimin is giving himself over.

Jungkook litters kisses from Jimin’s chin down to his neck, nipping and licking. Jimin feels Jungkook’s scent wash over him, a deep yearning inside Jimin getting sated with each nuzzle against Jimin’s scent gland. He moans and presses Jungkook closer, urging him to keep on scenting, marking and claiming him.

Jungkook grabs the hem of Jimin’s shirt and pulls it over his head while Jimin grabs Jungkook by his pants and leads Jungkook to the bedroom. He pushes Jungkook down onto the bed, hurriedly unbuttoning his pants. Jungkook helps him take them off and discards them carelessly.

Jimin watches Jungkook for a moment, carefully observing and admiring how his hard cock curls against his stomach, the head an angry red. Jimin has only sucked someone off twice in his life and isn’t great at it but he knows he’ll regret it if he doesn’t feel Jungkook’s weight against his tongue. Wrapping a hand around the base, Jimin wets his lips with his tongue and leans down to suckle on the tip. Jungkook hisses and Jimin takes that as a good sign, taking more of him into his mouth.

Jimin bops his head, moves his hand in sync with his mouth and sucks on the tip when he’s pulling back. He keeps going, until Jungkook starts cursing and his breathing gets heavier.

“W-wait,” Jungkook stutters and Jimin knows he’s close.

He doesn’t want to stop though. He wants to make his alpha come. So he keeps on going, sucking harder despite the ache in his jaw, until Jungkook is spurting hot spurts of come into his mouth. Jimin tries to swallow it all, doesn’t know what comes over him, but he doesn’t want to waste a single drop of Jungkook’s come. Some of it does escape and drips down Jungkook’s cock, so Jimin dutifully starts lapping it up as Jungkook comes down from his high.

“Fuck,” Jungkook curses and pulls Jimin away from his cock and on top of him, holding his jaw firmly in place as he kisses Jimin messily.

Jimin moans into mouth and asks through the kiss, “Was I good?”

“You were perfect.”

Jimin preens, satisfaction making him all tingly. Jungkook flips them over, making Jimin giggle at seeing the alpha’s eagerness, and removes Jimin’s pants in one swift movement. He plants himself between Jimin’s legs and strokes his thighs up and down.

“My little omega deserves a reward, don’t you think?” Jungkook asks.

Jimin moans, nodding repeatedly. “Yes, alpha.”

Something flashes in Jungkook’s eyes, something primal and carnal, and he leans down to devour Jimin’s lips once more, circling Jimin’s hole with one finger. Jimin moans and moves his hips in attempt to get the finger inside him. Jungkook smiles at his antics and slowly slips it inside. Jimin throws his head back, giving Jungkook access to mark his throat again. One finger is replaced by two soon, and those by three and it doesn’t take long for Jimin to get impatient again despite the stretch he’s feeling.

“Slow,” Jungkook whispers. “Shouldn’t you have learned from last time.”

Jimin pants and begs, “Please, alpha. Ne- ngh… need you.”

Jungkook sets his jaw but he remains firm in his decision, slipping four fingers into Jimin. Jimin whines but patiently holds out until Jungkook is satisfied with stretching him. He remembers what happened last time, and this time he’s in no mood to get his orgasm denied. His patience bears fruit when Jungkook finally pulls his fingers out, Jimin’s gaping hole twitching and closing around air, and lines himself up at Jimin’s hole.

Jungkook pushes in in one swift move, Jimin biting his lip through the stretch and pain. Jungkook gives him a moment to adjust but then he’s moving his hips already, seemingly as impatient as Jimin.

Jimin feels the slow drag of Jungkook’s cock against his walls and relishes the feeling, wanting to hold on to it forever. This time is far better than last time already. Jimin is no longer out of it from the effects of an aphrodisiac and he can fully enjoy every single second of it. He listens to Jungkook moan and grunt with each thrust, and holds onto his shoulders.

“Faster, alpha,” Jimin pants, hiccupping every time Jungkook pounds into him.

“My little omega is quite the cock slut, isn’t he?”

Jimin whimpers, embarrassment sending pleasant tingles all over his body.

“Y-your cock slut.”

Jungkook growls and changes the angle of Jimin’s hip slightly to pound into him more easily. Jimin mewls every time Jungkook’s head brushes against his prostate, stimulating the sensitive spot. Tightening his arms around Jungkook, Jimin buries his face in Jungkook’s neck, his canines itching. He searches for the spot that smells the sweetest, grazing it with his teeth. Jungkook keeps thrusting into Jimin until he feels a small resistance, stretching Jimin’s hole even further.

“Gonna knot and breed you,” Jungkook growls, hips pushing harder into Jimin, trying to fit his swelling base inside his omega.

Jimin moans loudly, getting closer to his climax, and urges Jungkook on to keep his promise. “Alpha, please breed me. Want your pups.”

It’s like Jimin isn’t even speaking, someone else inside him speaking for him. Jimin gasps when Jungkook almost fully pushes in, knowing that with the next thrust the time is right. Jungkook makes one last attempt to fit his knot inside, succeeding this time. Jimin screams, his orgasm washing over him and making him see black post. He closes his eyes, smells that sweet spot again and bites down until he’s drawing blood.

Jungkook growls, spurting more and more cum into Jimin as he rides out his orgasm. Jimin releases Jungkook’s shoulder, mouth full of blood, and sags against the bed. Jungkook has enough energy to flip them over so Jimin is on top of him, his knot pulling at Jimin’s abused rim, and falls limply on the bed, cock still twitching inside Jimin. Jimin didn’t even know someone could have this much cum.

Their breathing evens out slowly, their rationality returning with it.

“Fuck,” Jungkook curses.

“Fuck,” Jimin agrees.



It’s been three days now that Jimin bit Jungkook and completed the mating; three days in which Jungkook and Jimin never left the cabin and kept having sex. Neither of them thought about what they were doing back then but it’s hard not to do so anymore when they’re both sitting in the infirmary, a grumbly Yoongi inspecting them both, whereas another wolf stands by the side, watching. Jimin looks at Jungkook, the alpha smiling when he turns his head in sync, and smiles back.

Jimin doesn’t regret what happened.

“Can we finally know what is going on?” Jungkook asks once Yoongi steps back.

Namjoon, the other wolf who turned out to be the friend Jungkook mentioned in the past and was on a trip, takes Yoongi’s place.

“History,” Namjoon answers. “I hope you two used protection.”

Jimin goes beet red. Jungkook remains unaffected.

“He’s human, Namjoon,” Jungkook reminds the wolf. The fact that they didn't use protection is implied.

“Not anymore.”

Jimin stills, interested. Jungkook looks confused.

“What do you mean?”

“During my trip, I met many different packs and wolves. Some stricter than ours, completely cutting off all humans, and others not caring at all while living with them together. In one of those packs I learned that humans never stop being wolves. The difference between a human and a wolf is not the complete lack of the human’s second nature which makes them a wolf. It’s that their second nature is dormant.”

Jimin lets that information sink in and tries to process it. It does make sense. Jimin has been feeling like he isn’t alone in his body anymore, has been feeling too much, felt this primal attraction towards Jungkook and leaked slick. That his second nature woke up and made itself known, makes sense.

“What does that mean? How does that even happen?”

“There are multiple ways of doing it, and it isn’t always a success, but one of them is the mating bite, and the one you gave Jimin awakened his omega,” Namjoon explains.

Jungkook stares at Jimin, mouth wide open. “It makes sense, considering your physical changes but what? So he’s a full wolf? Can he shift?”

“That might be a bit tricky but some have mastered it.”

“Does that mean I’m pregnant?” Jimin asks, can’t shake that feeling of pride that mostly comes from his omega. They can get pregnant. They can give their alpha pups.

Damn, this omega is too focused on pleasing Jungkook.

“We can’t tell,” Yoongi says. “It hasn’t been that long. Damn, you two are work.”

Jungkook gets up from his chair and hugs Jimin tightly. Now that Jimin is aware of what is happening to him, he can pick up on Jungkook’s feelings through his scent and their bond, exactly the way Taehyung described. The terror that had been taking a hold of Jimin after finding out about his possible pregnancy slowly dwindles away as he concentrates on Jungkook’s happiness and pride.

“It’s going to be fine, I promise,” Jungkook whispers.

Jimin smiles, burrowing himself deeper into Jungkook’s arms. It’s going to be fine. Jungkook keeps his promises.
